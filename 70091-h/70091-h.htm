<span class="smcap">Preface</span>.<br>
<span class="smaller">TO THE</span><br>
<span class="larger">READERS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p><i>Had honor or applause and not the
publick advantage of English Readers
been the design of this Undertaking,
the consideration of
the common Fate of Translations had discouraged
Me from permitting this even to
have seen the light; for meer Versions do alwayes
carry with them this Property, that if
not well done they may much disgrace, but if
well, not much commend the doers.</i></p>

<p><i>And certainly I might well have expected
the same chance, had this been the Translation
of an History, Play or Romance; wherein
there is requisite not onely a bare version
but a conformation of Idiom and language,
manner and customary expression; But the
nature of this present Work will not admit
of the like liberty, and therefore, I hope, amongst
Judicious Readers it may be exempt
from the common Fate of Translations; for
if we look upon it as a Philosophical or Metaphysical
Tract, or rather as (really it is) a
Physico-Mathematical Argumentation, we
shall find that a great strictness of Expression
is requisite to be observed therein. So that
had a Translator taken upon him to use his
own liberty of Phrase, he would thereby have endanger’d
the sense and force of the Arguments;
for Politeness of language might as well be
expected in a Translation of <span class="antiqua">Euclide</span> as in
this. And all that are acquainted with this
famous Authors design, do very well know,
that it was his intention in these Meditations
<span class="antiqua">Mathematically to demonstrate</span>, that there
is a <span class="antiqua">God</span>, and that mans <span class="antiqua">mind</span> is <span class="antiqua">incorporeal</span>.
And it was his opinion, that metaphysicks
may as clearly be demonstrated as mathematicks,
as witness his expression in the Dedicatory
Epistle of this Work to the <span class="antiqua">Sorbone</span>
Doctors, <span class="antiqua">Eas</span> (Rationes scilicet) <span class="antiqua">quibus
hic utor certitudine &amp; evidentiâ Geometricas
æquare, vel etiam superare existimem</span>;
That he reputed his Arguments used
in these Meditations, to equal if not excell
Geometrical certainty.</i></p>

<p><i>And this, I suppose, is sufficient to make the
Reader, not expect herein any smoothness of
phrase or quaintness of Expression; what is
here delivered in English is immediately taken,
as it is naturally in the Original. The
words, we hope, may be apposite enough, and
fit to express what is here designed, and I
think it a derogation from the Authors skill to
draw the Picture of his mind in any other Colours,
than what his own Copy expresses.</i></p>

<p><i>Thus far in vindication of the Philosophical
plain stile and rough Language of the
following Translation. I shall add a line or
two, first relating to the Readers, secondly of
the Author, and lastly of the Meditations
themselves, together with the Motives which
excited me to this Work.</i></p>

<p><i>As to the Readers, ’tis, I suppose, so evident
that candour of mind, and freedome
from prejudice is requisite to all that desire to
advantage themselves by reading other mens
notions, that it need not be here insisted on
with much earnestness; yet considering the
Antiquity of this subject, and the novelty of
the Arguments here produced, it seems to be
more than ordinarily requisite for an impartial
perusal of the ensuing Tract. Neither are
the following Meditations to be slightly passed
over, but with diligence and attention to
be read; for as in mathematical demonstration,
the careless missing of any one single Position
may render the Conclusion obscure and
sometimes inconsequent, so in these metaphysical
Demonstrations, which (as, before has been
noted from the illustrious Author thereof) for
certainty do equal, if not excel Geometrical Propositions,
the slight attention to any one particular
Argument may frustrate the design of the
whole discourse.</i></p>

<p><i>The Reasoning therefore here being close
and solid, and (as in Mathematicks) the
knowledge of the latter depending on the
knowledge of what went before, ’tis the duty of
every Reader seriously to attend the Particulars,
as also the connexion of the whole. Let
him weigh the Arguments and perpend the
Conclusions, and after a clear and distinct
Knowledge, lett him pass his judgement.</i></p>

<p><i>And to this end I shall make it my request
to every Reader, that he would not be content
with a single perusal of the following Discourses,
but that he would often repeat his
reading them over; for by this means the force
of those Arguments, which at first may by
chance escape the most diligent and attentive
Peruser, by a second or third Essay may offer
themselves more fully to his Consideration.
This was the desire of our Author in an other
of his pieces, I mean his <span class="antiqua">Principles of Philosophy</span>,
which I am sure do not require so
strict an attention of mind, as these abstracted
speculations; and therefore if it
were his Request in that case, we may Reasonably
think that ’twas no less his desire in this.</i></p>

<p><i>When we come to speak of the Incomparable
Author of these Meditations, we have reason
to lament our own Ignorance, and to blame the
Ingratitude of the Age wherein he lived, for
not transmitting to Posterity more certain and
ample Records of the Life and Conversation
of this Excellent Philosopher, all that has
been Written in this kind gives us only so
much light into the Life of this Prodigious
Man, as may make us wish for more; imparting
which, I shall recommend the Readers to a
further enquiry into the inward Thoughts, (largly
discover’d in the Writings) of our Famous
Author, of whose outward actions and condition
we have so small knowledge.</i></p>

<p><i>Renatus Des-Cartes was born on the
last day of <span class="antiqua">March</span> in the year 1596. at
<span class="antiqua">Tours</span>, or at <span class="antiqua">Castrum Eraldum</span> a Town near
<span class="antiqua">Tours</span> in <span class="antiqua">France</span>; He came of an Antient
and Noble Family, being by Descent <span class="antiqua">Lord</span> of
<span class="antiqua">Perron</span>, His Father was a Senator of his Country,
and a Man of no mean estate, leaving to
this his only Son by a second Wife between six
and seven thousand pounds a year.</i></p>

<p><i>He was Educated in his younger years according
to the manner of his Country (and
as he himself recommends in one of his Epistles,
<span class="antiqua">viz. Epist. 90. partis secundæ</span> to One
for the Instruction of his Son) in the Aristotelian
principles of Philosophy, a whole course
whereof he had run through at the Age of seventeen
in the Schools of <span class="antiqua">Flexia</span>, or <span class="antiqua">La Flesche</span>
a Town in the Province of <span class="antiqua">Anjou</span>, famous
for the Colledge of Jesuites there establish’d
by <span class="antiqua">Henry</span> the <span class="antiqua">4th</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>But to this he did not Continue long devoted,
giving early testimonies of his dislike to
the unsatisfactory Notions, and verbose emptiness
of the Peripatetick Philosophy; He used
therefore his utmost endeavours (as he himself
testifies in his <span class="antiqua">Dissertatio de Methodo</span>)
to get loose from those Chains and Fetters of
Mind to which the weakness of his tender
years had subjected him.</i></p>

<p><i>To this end he betook himself to a long
course of Travel, that by the variety of Objects,
which he was likely to meet with in his journeys,
the memory of his past Notions might
be blotted out; In his travel he applied himself
much to the study of the Art Military,
and Mathematicks; In the latter he has left
the World large testimonies of his Excellence
in his <span class="antiqua">Book of Geometry</span>; and in the former
we have reason to believe him most expert,
for He was personally present at some Sieges
and Battles both in <span class="antiqua">France</span> and <span class="antiqua">Germany</span>, as
particularly at the Siege of <span class="antiqua">Rochel</span>, of <span class="antiqua">Gava</span>
near <span class="antiqua">Genoa</span>, of <span class="antiqua">Breda</span>, at the Battle of
<span class="antiqua">Prague</span>, <span class="antiqua">&amp;c.</span> so that we may conclude that he
had a Genius fitted (according to the Motto
of the noble <span class="antiqua">Sir W. Raliegh</span>) <span class="antiqua">Tam Marti,
quam Mercurio</span>, For the Pike as well as Pen.
And as the Glorious Roman Emperour became
a <span class="antiqua">Cæsar</span> by his Book as well as Sword, by
the Conquests of his mind as well as those of
his arm; so our Famous Author was <span class="antiqua">Ex Utroque
Clarus</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>In his Travels he spent many years, in all
which time he was not Idle, but highly improved
himself by his converse with the <span class="antiqua">Beaux
Esprits</span>, which he met with in several Regions
he visited; The first Place he betook himself
to, was <span class="antiqua">Italy</span>, then he went into <span class="antiqua">Denmark,
Germany, Hungary, &amp;c.</span> And after
a Long but advantagious Peregrination he return’d
to <span class="antiqua">Amsterdam</span>, where he intended to
take up his Rest, had he not been called by the
French King upon very Honourable terms to
<span class="antiqua">Paris</span>; During his Continuance there he so
order’d his annual Revenue, that he might be
supplied by the hands of a Friend wherever he
was. He staid at <span class="antiqua">Paris</span> three years, and then retired
Himself to a solitary village in <span class="antiqua">Holland</span>
called <span class="antiqua">Egmond</span>, where he lived twenty five
years, during which time he apply’d himself
wholly to the Restauration of true Philosophy,
wherein he gave the World such mighty testimonies
of his Excellence, that in a short time
he became celebrated in the mouths of all
Learned Men. Neither were the Courts of
Princes silent in his deserved Praises; for after
a Retirement of twenty five years he was
Invited by <span class="antiqua">Christina Queen of Sweedland</span> to
her Court; Thither upon the intreaty of this
brave and Learned Princess he betook himself,
where he had not continued Long before he
was struck with a Peripneumonia or Inflammation
of the Lungs (contracted, as it is
thought by the long Discourses which he used
to hold bare headed with the Queen, continuing
them sometimes till far in the Night,)
of which unhappy distemper he Died the seventh
Day after he sicken’d.</i></p>

<p><i>Thus Expired this Wonder of his Own and
succeeding Ages, desired and lamented by all
men, Æqual’d by none. He was buried in a
costly Monument consisting of four sides, upon
which were inscribed Epitaphs; bestow’d upon
him by many Renown’d Persons.</i></p>

<p><i>What shall we now say sufficient to express
our Grief for the untimely Decease of this
Worthy Philosopher? But Especially what
shall we now do to recover our Loss? Let us
endeavour to Redeem what we have lost by
well Husbanding and careful improvement of
what is left; which may be done in Part by a
Diligent Perusal of the Works written by this
Excellent Author; This, This only is the way of
Reviving him again, and of giving him Immortality
in spight of his untimely Fate. And
so let him for ever live celebrated by the Deserved
Praises of all ingenious Enquirers after
truth, and Learning.</i></p>

<p><i>Let us therefore cast our eye upon the Present
Work of this extroardinary Philosopher,
and therein let us admire his profound Judgment
and vigorous Fancy, for if we seriously
consider it, we shall hardly find a more
solid close piece of Reasoning either in this
or Foregoing ages; <span class="antiqua">Here</span>, what was commonly
asserted without proof, is not only proved
but <span class="antiqua">Mathematically</span> Demonstrated, <span class="antiqua">viz.</span>
That <span class="antiqua">God is the Fountain and Original of
Truth</span>; His sharp Wit, like <span class="antiqua">Hannibals</span> Vinegar,
hath eaten thro the Mazing and overtowring
hills of Errors, a Plain and Pleasant Way
to the Divine seat of Knowledge.</i></p>

<p><i>In fine, such is the Excellence of these six
Meditations, that I cannot resemble his Performance
herein better than to the Six Days
Work of the Supream Architect; and certainly
next to the Creation of All things out
of Nothing, the Restauration of Truth out of
Errors is the most Divine Work; so that (with
Reverence be it spoken) the Incomparable <span class="antiqua">Des-Cartes</span>
does hereby deserve as it were the name
of a Creatour. In the first Meditation we are
Presented with a Rude and Indigested Chaos
of Errours and Doubts, till the Divine spirit
of the Noble <span class="antiqua">Des-Cartes</span> (pardon the Boldness
of the Expression) <span class="antiqua">moves upon the confused
face of these Waters</span>, and thereout produces
some <span class="antiqua">clear</span> and <span class="antiqua">distinct Light</span>; by which
<span class="antiqua">Sun-shine</span> he proceeds to bring forth and cherish
other <span class="antiqua">Branches of Truth</span>; Till at last by
a six Days Labour he Establishes this Fair
Fabrick (as I may call it) of the <span class="antiqua">Intellectual
World</span> on foundations that shall never be
shaken. Then sitting down with rest and satisfaction
he looks upon this his Off-spring
and Pronounces it <span class="antiqua">Good</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>These Things Consider’d, I need not make
any long Apologies for my undertaking a translation
thereof; The excellency of the Original
is sufficient to vindicate my endeavours
to present the English World with a Copy, and
he that shall blame my Intentions of Communicating
the Methods of Truth to those
that have only the English Tongue, may as well
find fault with those English that propagate
the Christian Religion among savage Indians,
and translate the Scriptures into their Language,
because they have not the English Tongue.
To understand Latin is no (or at most a very
small) part of Learning, and that which certainly
every Cobler in <span class="antiqua">Rome</span> was once endow’d
with; and therefore must there then be no
translations out of Greek into Latin? I doubt
not, but there are many Persons in our Nations,
who tho wanting Latin, are notwithstanding
very capable of the most abstracted speculations;
the late disturbances of our Kingdomes
occasion’d many Youths, who were then
in a fair way of Instruction, to forsake their
learning, and divert their intentions from
Literature to Arms, and yet many of these
have afterwards become Men of extraordinary
nary abilities and qualifications for learning
notwithstanding their deficiency in the Roman
Tongue. And I see no Reason why it should
not be the desire, and consequently the endeavour
of every true English man, to make
his language as universal as is now the <span class="antiqua">French</span>,
into which the best Books in all sorts of Learning,
both Poetry and Prose, are daily translated
out of all languages, but especially out
of Greek and Latine. Among which these
Meditations are to be found, entituled, <span class="antiqua">Les
Meditations Metaphysiques De Rene Des
Cartes touchant la Premiere Philosophie</span>.
This was translated out of the Authors Latine
into French by <span class="antiqua">Monsieur le D. D. L. N. S.</span>
The several Objections also, which were made
by divers learned Persons against these Meditations,
with the Authors Answers, were translated
into French by <span class="antiqua">M. B. L. R.</span> And, I
hope, no one will assert, that the French are
more fit to receive those metaphysical Notions
delivered herein than the English Nation.</i></p>

<p><i>But ’twas none of the smallest motives I
had to this undertaking, that tho some famous
English Authours have taken notice of
the Arguments here produced (for the proof
of a <span class="antiqua">Deity</span> drawn from the <span class="antiqua">Idea</span> we have of
<span class="antiqua">God</span> in our Mind, <span class="antiqua">&amp;c.</span>) Particularly the
most excellent and learned <span class="antiqua">Dr. Stillingfleet</span>
in the first Chapter of the third Book in his
<span class="antiqua">Origines Sacræ</span>, who refers his Readers to
a further search into these Meditations in the
<span class="antiqua">400 page</span> of that Discourse; as also the
Reverend Dr. <span class="antiqua">Henry More</span> in his <span class="antiqua">Antidote
against Atheism</span>, and more fully in his
<span class="antiqua">Appendix</span> annex’d thereto, hath treated of
our Authors demonstration; and yet nothing
of the genuine original from whence they have
borrowed all their Copies (tho some of them
drawn in a larger size, yet I question whether
so expressive) nothing of our Authors proper
management hath ever appear’d in English.
Those that assert these Arguments to have
been long before thought upon by some of the
Fathers, I shall refer to our Authors just vindication
of himself in his several Answers to
Objections made against these Discourses.</i></p>

<p><i>And here I shall dismiss the Reader detaining
him no longer from that satisfaction which
he may reasonably expect from the perusal of
the following Meditations; this Translation
is dedicated to no one in particular, but is humbly
submitted to the moderate censure of all
candid Readers, by</i></p>

<i class="smaller">Of Things Doubtful.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Some years past I perceived how
many <i>Falsities</i> I admitted as
<i>Truths</i> in my Younger years, and
how <i>Dubious</i> those things were
which I raised from thence; and
therefore I thought it requisite (if I had
a designe to establish any thing that
should prove <i>firme</i> and <i>permanent</i> in sciences)
that once in my life I should clearly
cast aside all my former opinions, and
begin a new from some <i>First principles</i>.
But this seemed a great Task, and I still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
expected that maturity of years, then
which none could be more apt to receive
Learning; upon which Account I waited
so long, that at last I should deservedly
be blamed had I spent that time in <i>Deliberation</i>
which remain’d only for <i>Action</i>.</p>

<p>This day therefore I conveniently released
my mind from all cares, I procured
to my self a Time Quiet, and free
from all Business, I retired my self Alone;
and now at length will I freely and
seriously apply my self to the General overthrow
of all my former Opinions.</p>

<p>To the Accomplishment of Which, it
will not be necessary for me to prove
them all <i>false</i> (for that perhaps I shall
never atcheive) But because my reason
perswades me, that I must withdraw my
assent no less from those opinions which
seem <i>not so very certain</i> and <i>undoubted</i>,
then I should from those that are <i>Apparently
false</i>, it will be sufficient if I reject all
those wherein I find any <i>Occasion</i> of
doubt.</p>

<p>Neither to effect this is it necessary,
that they all should be run over particularly
(which would be an endles trouble)
but because the <i>Foundation</i> being once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
undermin’d, whatever is built thereon
will of its own accord come to the
ground, I shall therefore immediately assault
the very <i>principle</i>, on which whatever
I have believed was <i>grounded</i>. Viz.</p>

<p><i>Whatever I have hitherto admitted as most
true, that I received either from, or by my
Senses; but these I have often found to deceive
me, and ’tis prudence never certainly to
trust those that I have (tho but once) deceived
us.</i></p>

<p>1 <i>Doubt.</i> But tho sometimes the <i>senses</i>
deceive us being exercised about <i>remote</i>
or <i>small</i> objects, yet there are many other
things of which we cannot doubt
tho we know them only by the senses?
as that at present I am in this place, that
I am sitting by a fire, that I have a Winter
gown on me, that I feel this Paper
with my hands; But how can it be denied
that these hands or this body is mine?
Unless I should compare my self to those
mad men, whose brains are disturbed by
such a disorderly melancholick vapour,
that makes them continually profess themselves
to be Kings, tho they are very poor,
or fancy themselves cloathed in Purple
Robes, tho they are naked, or that their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
heads are made of Clay as a bottle, or of
glass, <i>&amp;c.</i> But these are mad men, and I
should be as mad as they in following
their example by fancying these things as
they do.</p>

<p>1 <i>Solution.</i> This truly would seem very
clear to those that never <i>sleep</i>, and suffer
the same things (and sometimes more
unlikely) in their repose, then these mad
men do whilst they are awake; for how
often am I perswaded in a Dream of these
usual occurrences, that I am in this place,
that I have a Gown on me, that I am sitting
by a fire, <i>&amp;c.</i> Tho all the while I am
lying naked between the Sheets.</p>

<p>But now I am certain that I am awake
and look upon this Paper, neither is this
head which I shake asleep, I knowingly
and willingly stretch out this hand, and
am sensible that things so distinct could
not happen to one that sleeps. As if I
could not remember my self to have been
deceived formerly in my sleep by the like
thoughts; which while I consider more
attentively I am so far convinced of the
difficulty of distinguishing sleep from waking
that I am amazed, and this very amazement
almost perswades me that I am
asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>2 <i>Doubt.</i> Wherefore let us suppose our
selves <i>asleep</i>, and that these things are not
<i>true</i>, viz. that we open our eyes, move our
heads, stretch our hands, and perhaps that
we have no such things as hands or a body.
Yet we must confess, that what we see in
a Dream is (as it were) <i>a painted Picture</i>,
which cannot be devised but after the
<i>likeness</i> of some <i>real</i> thing; and that
therefore these Generals at least, <i>viz.</i> eyes,
head, hands, and the whole body are
things <i>really existent</i> and not <i>imaginary</i>;
For Painters themselves, (even then when
they design Mermaids and Satyrs in the
most unusual shapes) do not give them
natures altogether new, but only add the
divers Parts of different Animals together;
And if by chance they invent any
thing so new that nothing was ever seen
like it, for that ’tis wholy fictitious and
false, yet the colours at least of which,
they make it must be <i>true Colours</i>; so upon
the same account, tho these General things
as eyes, head, hands, <i>&amp;c.</i> may be imaginary;
yet nevertheless we must of necessity
confess the more <i>simple</i> and <i>universal</i>
things to be <i>True</i>, of which (as of true
Colours) these <i>Images</i> of things (whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
<i>true</i> or <i>false</i>) which are in our minds are
made; such as are the nature of a body
in General, and its Extension, also the
shape of things extended, with the quantity
or bigness of them; their number also,
and place wherein they are, the time
in which they continue, and the like, and
therefore from hence we make no bad conclusion,
that <i>Physick</i>, both <i>Natural</i>, and
<i>Medicinal</i>, <i>Astronomy</i>, and all other <i>sciences</i>,
which depend on the consideration
of <i>compound things</i>, are <i>Doubtful</i>. But
that <i>Arithmetick</i>, <i>Geometry</i>, and the like
(which treat only of the most <i>simple</i>, and
<i>General</i> things not regarding whether they
really are or not) have in them something
<i>certain</i> and <i>undoubted</i>; for whether I sleep
or wake, <i>two</i> and <i>three</i> added make five;
a <i>square</i> has no more sides than <i>four</i> <i>&amp;c.</i>
neither seems it possible what such <i>plain
truths</i> can be <i>doubted</i> off.</p>

<p>2 <i>Solution.</i> But all this While there is
rooted in my mind a certain old opinion
of the <i>being</i> of an <i>Omnipotent God</i>, by
whom I am <i>created</i> in the state I am in;
and how know I but he caused that there
should be no Earth, no Heaven, no Body,
no Figure, no Magnitude, no Place,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
and yet that all these things should seem
to me to be as now they are? And as I
very often judge others to Erre about
those things which they think they
<i>Throughly understand</i>, so why may not I
be <i>deceived</i>, whenever I add <i>two</i> and <i>three</i>,
or count the sides of a Square, or whatever
other easy Matter can be thought
of?</p>

<p>3. <i>Doubt</i>. But perhaps <i>God wills not</i>
that I should be <i>deceived</i>, for he is said to
be <i>Infinitely Good</i>.</p>

<p>3. <i>Solution.</i> Yet if it were <i>Repugnant</i> to
his <i>Goodness</i> to create me so that I should
be <i>always deceived</i>, it seems also <i>unagreeable</i>
to his <i>Goodness</i> to permit me to be
deceived <i>at any time</i>; Which last no one
will affirme: Some there are truely who
had rather deny <i>Gods Omnipotence</i>, then beleive
all things <i>uncertain</i>; but there at present
we may not contradict. And we
will suppose all this of <i>God</i> to be <i>false</i>;
yet whether they will suppose me to become
what <i>I</i> am by Fate, by <i>Chance</i>, by
a <i>continued chain</i> of <i>causes</i>, or any other
way, because to <i>erre</i> is an <i>Imperfection</i>, by
how much the less <i>power</i> they will Assigne
to the <i>Author</i> of my <i>Being</i>, so much the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
more Probable it will be, that I am so
<i>Imperfect</i> as to be <i>alwayes deceived</i>.</p>

<p>To which Arguments I know not
what to answer but am forced to confess,
that there is nothing of all those things
which I formerly received as <i>Truths</i>,
whereof at present I may not <i>doubt</i>;
and this doubt shall not be grounded on
inadvertency or Levity, but upon strong
and Premeditated reasons; and therefore
I must hereafter (if I designe to discover
any truths) withdraw my assent
from them no less then from <i>apparent
falshoods</i>.</p>

<p>But ’tis not sufficient to think only
<i>Transiently</i> on these things, but I must
take care to <i>remember</i> them; for dayly
my old opinions returne upon me, and
much against my Will almost possesse my
Beleife tyed to them, as it were by a continued
<i>use</i> and <i>Right</i> of <i>Familiarity</i>; neither
shall I ever cease to <i>assent</i> and <i>trust</i> in
them, whilst I suppose them as in themselves
they really are, that is to say, <i>something
doubtful</i> (as now I have proved) yet
notwithstanding <i>highly Probable</i>, which
it is much more Reasonable to beleive
then disbeleive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>Wherefore I conceive I should not do
amiss, if (with my mind bent clearly to
the contrary side) I should deceive my
self, and suppose them for a While altogether
<i>false</i> and <i>Imaginary</i>; till at length
the Weights of prejudice being equal in
each scale, no ill custome may any more
Draw my Judgement from the <i>true Conception</i>
of things, for I know from hence
will follow no dangerous Error, and
I can’t too immoderately pamper my
own Incredulity, seeing What I am about,
concernes not <i>Practice</i> but <i>Speculation</i>.</p>

<p>To Which end I will suppose, not an
<i>Infinitely perfect God</i>, the <i>Fountain</i> of
<i>truth</i>, but that some <i>Evil Spirit</i> which is
very <i>Powerful</i> and <i>crafty</i> has used all his
endeavours to <i>deceive</i> me; I will conceive,
the Heavens, Air, Earth, Colours, Figures,
Sounds, and all outward things
are nothing else but the delusions of
Dreams, by which he has laid snares to
catch my easy beleif; I will consider my
self as not having hands, Eyes, Flesh,
Blood, or Sences, but that <i>I</i> falsely think
that <i>I</i> have all these; <i>I</i> will continue firmly
in this Meditation; and tho it lyes not
in my power to <i>discover any truth</i>, yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
this is in my power, not to <i>assent to Falsities</i>,
and with a strong resolution take
care that the <i>Mighty deceiver</i> (tho never so
<i>powerful</i> or <i>cunning</i>) impose not any thing
on my beleife.</p>

<p>But this is a laborious intention, and
a certain sloth reduces me to the usual
course of life, and like a Prisoner who in
his sleep perhaps enjoy’d an imaginary liberty,
and when he begins to suppose that
he is asleep is afraid to waken, but is willing
to be deceived by the <i>Pleasant delusion</i>;
so I willingly fall into my opinions,
and am afraid to be Roused, least a
toilsome waking succeeding a pleasant
rest I may hereafter live not in the <i>light</i>,
but in the confused <i>darkness</i> of the <i>doubts</i>
now raised.</p>

<i class="smaller"><span class="antiqua">Of the nature of Mans mind</span>, and
that ’tis easier proved to <span class="antiqua">be</span> then our
<span class="antiqua">body</span>.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>By yesterdays Meditation I am cast
into so great <i>Doubts</i>, that I shall never
forget them, and yet I know not
how to answer them, but being plunged
on a suddain into a deep Gulf, I am so amazed
that I can neither touch the bottome,
nor swim at the top.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I will endeavour once
more, and try the way I set on yesterday,
by removing from me whatever is in the
<i>least doubtful</i>, as if I had certainly discover’d
it to be <i>altogether false</i>, and will proceed
till I find out some <i>certainty</i>, or if
nothing else, yet at least this <i>certainty, That
there is nothing sure</i>.</p>

<p><i>Archimedes</i> required but a <i>point</i> which
was <i>firm</i>, and <i>immoveable</i> that he might
move the <i>whole Earth</i>, so in the perfect undertaking
Great things may be expected,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
if I can discover but the <i>least thing</i> that
is <i>true</i> and <i>indisputable</i>.</p>

<p>Wherefore I suppose all things I see
are <i>false</i>, and believe that nothing of those
things are really existent, which my deceitful
memory represents to me; ’tis
evident I have no senses, that a Body, Figure,
Extension, Motion, Place, <i>&amp;c.</i> are
meer Fictions; what thing therefore is
there that is <i>true</i>? perhaps only <i>this, That
there is nothing certain.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Doubts and Solutions.</i></div>

<p>But how know I that there is
nothing <i>distinct</i> from all these
things (which I have now reckon’d) of
which I have no reason to <i>doubt</i>? Is
there no <i>God</i> (or whatever other name I
may call him) who has put these thoughts
into me? Yet why should I think this?
When I my self perhaps am the <i>Author</i> of
them. Upon which Account, therefore
must not I be something? ’tis but just now
that I denied that I had any <i>senses</i>, or any
<i>Body</i>. Hold a while—Am I so tied
to a <i>Body</i> and <i>senses</i> that I cannot <i>exist</i>
without them? But I have perswaded my
self that there is nothing in the World,
no Heaven, no Earth, no Souls, no Bodies;
and then why not, that I <i>my self am not</i>?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
Yet surely if <i>I</i> could perswade my self any
thing, <i>I was</i>.</p>

<p>But there is <i>I</i> know not what sort of
<i>Deceivour</i> very <i>powerful</i> and very <i>crafty</i>,
who always strives to <i>deceive</i> Me; without
Doubt therefore <i>I am</i>, if he can <i>decieve
me</i>; And let him <i>Deceive</i> me as much
as he can, yet he can never make me <i>not
to Be</i>, whilst <i>I think that I am</i>. Wherefore
<i>I</i> may lay this down as a <i>Principle, that
whenever this sentence I am, I exist, is spoken
or thought of by Me, ’tis necessarily
True</i>.</p>

<p>But <i>I</i> do not yet fully understand <i>who
I am</i> that now necessarily <i>exist</i>, and <i>I</i>
must hereafter take care, least <i>I</i> foolishly
<i>mistake</i> some other thing <i>for my self</i>, and
by that means be <i>deceived</i> in that thought,
which <i>I</i> defend as the most <i>certain</i> and <i>evident</i>
of all.</p>

<p>Wherefore <i>I</i> will again Recollect, what
<i>I</i> believed <i>my self to be</i> heretofore, before
<i>I</i> had set upon these Meditations, from
which <i>Notion I</i> will withdraw whatever
may be <i>Disproved</i> by the <i>Foremention’d
Reasons</i>, that in the End, <i>That</i> only may
Remain which is <i>True</i> and <i>indisputable</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>What therefore have I heretofore
thought my self? <i>A Man.</i> But what is
a man? Shall I answer, a <i>Rational Animal</i>?
By no means; because afterwards
it may be asked, what an <i>Animal</i> is? and
what <i>Rational</i> is? And so from one <i>question</i>
I may fall into greater <i>Difficulties</i>;
neither at present have I so much time as
to spend it about such Niceties.</p>

<p>But I shall rather here Consider, what
heretofore represented it self to my
thoughts <i>freely</i>, and <i>naturally</i>, whenever
I set my self to understand <i>What I my self
was</i>.</p>

<p>And the first thing I find Representing
it self is, that I have <i>Face</i>, <i>Hands</i>, <i>Arms</i>,
and this whole <i>frame</i> of <i>parts</i> which is
seen in my <i>Body</i>, and which I call my
<i>Body</i>.</p>

<p>The next thing represented to me was,
that I was <i>nourish’d</i>, could <i>walk</i>, had
<i>senses</i>, and could <i>Think</i>; which functions
I attributed to my <i>Soul</i>. Yet what
this <i>soul</i> of mine was, I did not fully conceive;
or else supposed it a small thing
like <i>wind</i>, or <i>fire</i>, or <i>aire</i>, infused through
my <i>stronger parts</i>.</p>

<p>As to my <i>Body</i> truly <i>I</i> doubted not,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
but that <i>I</i> rightly understood its <i>Nature</i>,
which (if <i>I</i> should endeavour to describe
as <i>I</i> conceive it) <i>I</i> should thus Explain,
<i>viz.</i> By a <i>Body</i> <i>I</i> mean whatever is <i>capable</i>
of <i>Shape</i>, or can be <i>contained</i> in a
<i>place</i>, and so fill’s a space that it excludes
all other <i>Bodys</i> out of the same, that which
may be <i>touch’d</i>, <i>seen</i>, <i>heard</i>, <i>tasted</i>, or
<i>smelt</i>, and that which is <i>capable</i> of <i>various</i>
<i>Motions</i> and <i>Modifications</i>, not from it
<i>self</i>, but from any <i>other thing moving</i> it,
for <i>I</i> judged it <i>against</i> (or rather <i>above</i>)
the <i>nature</i> of a <i>Body</i> to <i>move it self</i>, or
<i>perceive</i>, or <i>think</i>, But rather admired
that <i>I</i> should find these <i>Operations</i> in certain
<i>Bodys</i>.</p>

<p>But How now (since <i>I</i> suppose
a certain <i>powerful</i> and (if
it be lawful to call him so) <i>evil
deluder</i>, who useth all his endeavours to deceive
me in all things) can <i>I</i> affirme that
I have any of those things, which I have
now said belong to the <i>nature</i> of a <i>Body</i>?
Hold— Let me Consider—, Let me
think—, Let me reflect— I can find no
Answer, and I am weary with repeating
the same things over-again in
vain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>But Which of these <i>Faculties</i> did I attribute
to my <i>Soul</i>, my <i>Nutritive</i>, or <i>Motive
faculty</i>? yet now seeing I have no
<i>Body</i>, these also are <i>meer delusions</i>. Was
it my <i>sensitive faculty</i>? But this also cannot
be perform’d without a <i>Body</i>, and I
have seem’d to <i>perceive</i> many things in my
<i>sleep</i>, of which I afterwards understood
my self <i>not</i> to be <i>sensible</i>. Was it my <i>Cogitative
Faculty</i>? Here I have discovered
it, ’tis my <i>Thought</i>, this alone cannot be
separated from Me, I <i>am</i>, I <i>exist</i>,⸺<i>tis
true</i>, but for what time <i>Am I</i>? Why <i>I
am</i> as long as <i>I think</i>; For it May be that
When I cease from <i>thinking</i>, I may cease
from being. Now I admit of nothing
but what is necessarily true: In short therefore
I <i>am</i> only a <i>thinking thing</i> that is to
say, a <i>mind</i>, or a <i>soul</i>, or
<i>understanding</i>, or <i>Reason</i>,
words which formerly <i>I</i>
understood not; I am
a <i>Real thing</i>, and <i>Really Existent</i>, But
what sort of thing? I have just now said
it, <i>A thinking thing</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">* <i>Places noted with their Asterisk are refer’d to in the following Objections.</i></div>

<p>But am I nothing besides? I will consider⸺I
am not that <i>structure</i> of <i>parts</i>,
which is called a Mans <i>Body</i>, neither am I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
any sort of <i>thin Air</i> infused into those
Parts, nor a <i>Wind</i>, nor <i>Fire</i>, nor <i>Vapour</i>,
nor <i>Breath</i>, nor whatever I my self can
feign, for all these things I have supposed
<i>not to Be</i>. Yet my Position stands firm;
<i>Nevertheless I am something.</i> Yet perhaps
it so falls out that these very things which
I suppose not to exist (because to me <i>unknown</i>)
are in reallity nothing <i>different</i>
from that very <i>Self</i>, which I <i>know</i>. I cannot
tell, I dispute it not now, I can only
give my opinion of those things whereof
I have some knowledge. I am sure that
I exist, I ask who I am whom I thus know,
certainly, the knowledge, of <i>Me</i>
(precisely taken) depends not on those
things, whose existence I am yet ignorant
of; and therefore not on any other
things that I can <i>feign</i> by my <i>imagination</i>.</p>

<p>And this very Word (<i>feign</i>) puts me in
mind of my <i>error</i>, for I should <i>feign</i> in
deed, if I should <i>imagine</i> my self any
thing; for to <i>imagine</i> is nothing else but
to think upon the <i>shape</i> or <i>image</i> of a <i>corporeal</i>
thing; but now I certainly know
that I <i>am</i>, and I know also that ’tis possible
that all these <i>images</i>, and generally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
whatever belongs to the <i>Nature</i> of a <i>Body</i>
are nothing but <i>deluding Dreams</i>.
Which things Consider’d I should be no
less Foolish in saying, <i>I will imagine that I
may more throughly understand what I am</i>,
then if I should say, <i>at Present I am awake
and perceive something true, but because it
appears not evidently enough, I shall endeavour
to sleep, that in a Dream I may perceive
it more evidently and truely</i>.</p>

<p>Wherefore I know that nothing that I
can comprehend by my <i>imagination</i>, can
belong to the <i>Notion</i> I have of <i>my self</i>,
and that I must carefully withdraw my
mind from those things that it may more
<i>distinctly</i> perceive its <i>own Nature</i>.</p>

<p>Let me ask therefore <i>What I am, A
Thinking Thing</i>, but What is That? That
is a thing, <i>doubting</i>, <i>understanding</i>, <i>affirming</i>,
<i>denying</i>, <i>willing</i>, <i>nilling</i>, <i>imagining</i> also,
and <i>sensitive</i>. These truely are not a few
<i>Properties</i>, if they all belong to Me. And
Why should they Not belong to me? For
am not I the very same who at present <i>doubt</i>
almost of All things; yet <i>understand</i> something,
which thing onely I <i>affirm</i> to be
true, I <i>deny</i> all other things, I am <i>willing</i>
to know more, I <i>would not</i> be deceived, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
<i>imagine</i> many things <i>unwillingly</i>, and <i>consider</i>
many things as coming to me by my
<i>senses</i>. Which of all these faculties is it,
which is not as <i>true</i> as that I <i>Exist</i>, tho I
should <i>sleep</i>, or my <i>Creatour</i> should as
much as in him lay, strive to <i>deceive</i> Me?
which of them is it that is <i>distinct</i> from my
<i>thought</i>? which of them is it that can be
<i>seperated</i> from <i>me</i>? For that I am the same
that <i>doubt</i>, <i>understand</i>, and <i>will</i> is so <i>evident</i>,
that I know not how to explain it
more <i>manifestly</i>, and that I also am the
same that <i>imagine</i>, for tho perhaps (as I
have supposed) no thing that can be <i>imagined</i>
is <i>true</i>, yet the <i>imaginative Power</i> it
self is <i>really</i> existent, and makes up a part
of my <i>Thought</i>; and last of all that I am
the same that am <i>sensitive</i>, or <i>perceive corporeal</i>
things as by my <i>senses</i>, yet that I now
<i>see</i> light, <i>hear</i> a noise, <i>feel</i> heat, these things
are false, for I suppose my self <i>asleep</i>, but
I <i>know</i> that I <i>see</i>, <i>hear</i>, and am <i>heated</i>, that
cannot be <i>false</i>; and this it is that in me
is <i>properly</i> called <i>Sense</i>, and this strictly taken
is the same with <i>thought</i>.</p>

<p>By these Considerations I begin a little
better to <i>understand My self</i> what I am;
But yet it <i>seems</i>, and I cannot but <i>think</i> that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
<i>Corporeal Things</i> (whose <i>Images</i> are formed
in my <i>thought</i>, and which by my <i>senses</i>, I
perceive) are much more <i>distinctly known</i>,
then that <i>confused Notion</i> of <i>My Self</i> which
<i>imagination</i> cannot afford me. And yet
’tis strange that things <i>doubtful</i>, <i>unknown</i>,
<i>distinct from Me</i>, should be <i>apprehended</i>
more <i>clearly</i> by <i>Me</i>, then a Thing that is
<i>True</i>, then a thing that is <i>known</i>, or then <i>I
my self</i>; But the Reason is, that my Mind
loves to wander, and suffers not it self to
be bounded within the strict limits of
<i>Truth</i>.</p>

<p>Let it therefore Wander, and once
more let me give it the Free Reins, that
hereafter being conveniently curbed, it
may suffer it self to be more easily Govern’d.</p>

<p>Let me consider those things which of
all Things I formerly conceived most <i>evident</i>,
that is to say, <i>Bodies</i> which we
touch, which we see, not bodies in General
(for those <i>General</i> Conceptions are usually
<i>Confused</i>) but some one <i>Body</i> in particular.</p>

<p>Let us chuse for example this piece of
<i>Bees-wax</i>, it was lately taken from the
<i>Comb</i>, it has not yet lost all the <i>tast</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
the <i>Honey</i>, it retains something of the
<i>smell</i> of the <i>Flowers</i> from whence ’twas
gather’d, its <i>colour</i>, <i>shape</i>, and <i>bigness</i> are
manifest, ’tis <i>hard</i>, ’tis <i>cold</i>, ’tis <i>easily felt</i>,
and if you will knock it with your finger,
’twill <i>make a noise</i>: In fine, it hath all
things requisite to the most perfect notion
of a <i>Body</i>.</p>

<p>But behold whilst I am speaking, ’tis
put to the Fire, its <i>tast</i> is purged away,
the <i>smell</i> is vanish’d, the <i>colour</i> is changed,
the <i>shape</i> is alter’d, its <i>bulk</i> is increased,
its become <i>soft</i>, ’tis <i>hot</i>, it can scarce
be <i>felt</i>, and now (though you strike it)
it makes no <i>noise</i>. Does it yet continue
the same Wax? surely it does, this all
confess, no one denies it, no one doubts
it. What therefore was there in it that
was so evidently known? surely none of
those things which I <i>perceived</i> by my <i>senses</i>;
for what I <i>smelt</i>, <i>tasted</i>, have <i>seen</i>,
<i>felt</i>, or <i>heard</i>, are all <i>vanish’d</i>, and yet the
<i>Wax remains</i>. Perhaps ’twas this only
that I now think on, <i>viz.</i> that the <i>Wax</i>
it self was not that <i>tast of Honey</i>, that
<i>smell of Flowers</i>, that <i>whiteness</i>, that
<i>shape</i>, or that <i>sound</i>, but it was a <i>Body</i>
which awhile before appear’d to me <i>so</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
and <i>so modified</i>, but now <i>otherwise</i>. But
what is it strictly that I thus imagine?
let me consider: And having rejected
whatever belongs not to the Wax, let me
see what will remain, <i>viz.</i> this only, a
<i>thing extended</i>, <i>flexible</i>, and <i>mutable</i>. But
what is this <i>flexible</i>, and <i>mutable</i>? is it
that I <i>imagine</i> that this Wax from being
<i>round</i> may be made <i>square</i>, or from being
<i>square</i> can be made <i>triangular</i>? No,
this is not it; for I conceive it capable
of <i>innumerable</i> such <i>changes</i>, and yet I
cannot by my <i>imagination</i> run over these
<i>Innumerables</i>; Wherefore this notion of
its <i>mutability</i> proceeds not from my <i>imagination</i>.
What then is <i>extended</i>? is not
its <i>Extension</i> also <i>unknown</i>? For when it
<i>melts</i> ’tis <i>greater</i>, when it <i>boils</i> ’tis <i>greater</i>,
and yet <i>greater</i> when the heat is increas’d;
and I should not rightly judge of the
Wax, did I not think it capable of more
various <i>Extensions</i> than I can <i>imagine</i>. It
remains therefore for me only to confess,
that I cannot <i>imagine</i> what this Wax is,
but that I <i>perceive</i> with my <i>Mind</i> what it
is. I speak of this <i>particular</i> Wax, for of
Wax in <i>general</i> the <i>notion</i> is more <i>clear</i>.</p>

<p>But what Wax is this that I only conceive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
by my mind? ’Tis the same which
I see, which I touch, which I imagine, and
in fine, the same which at first I judged
it to be. But this is to be noted, that the
<i>perception</i> thereof is not <i>sight</i>, the
<i>touch</i>, or the <i>imagination</i> thereof; neither
was it ever so, though at first it seem’d so.
But the <i>perception</i> thereof is the <i>inspection</i>
or <i>beholding</i> of the Mind only, which may
be either <i>imperfect</i> and <i>confused</i>, as formerly
it was; or <i>clear</i> and <i>distinct</i>, as
now it is; the <i>more</i> or the <i>less</i> I consider
the Composition of the Wax.</p>

<p>In the interim, I cannot but admire
how prone my mind is to erre; for
though I revolve these things with my
self <i>silently</i>, and <i>without speaking</i>, yet am
I intangled in <i>meer words</i>, and am almost
deceived by the usual way of <i>expression</i>;
for we commonly say, <i>that we see the Wax
it self if it be present</i>, and not, <i>that we
judge it present by its colour or shape</i>; from
whence I should immediately thus conclude,
therefore the Wax is known by
the <i>sight</i> of the <i>eye</i>, and not by the <i>inspection</i>
of the <i>mind</i> only. Thus I should
have concluded, had not I by chance
look’d out of my window, and seen men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
passing by in the Street; which men I as
usually say that I <i>see</i>, as I do now, that
I <i>see</i> this Wax; and yet I see nothing
but their Hair and Garments, which perhaps
may cover only <i>artificial Machines</i>
and <i>movements</i>, but I judge them to be
men; so that what I thought I only <i>saw</i>
with my eyes, I comprehend by my <i>Judicative
Faculty</i>, which is <i>my Soul</i>. But it
becomes not one, who desires to be wiser
than the Vulgar, to draw matter of <i>doubt</i>
from those ways of <i>expression</i>, which the
Vulgar have invented.</p>

<p>Wherefore let us proceed and consider,
whether I perceived more <i>perfectly</i>
and <i>evidently</i> what the Wax was, when I
first look’d on’t, and believed that I
knew it by my outward <i>senses</i>, or at least
by my <i>common sense</i> (as they call it) that
is to say, <i>by my imagination</i>; or whether
at present I <i>better understand</i> it, after I
have more diligently enquired both <i>what
it is</i>, and how it may be <i>known</i>. Surely
it would be a foolish thing to make it
matter of doubt to know which of these
parts are true; What was there in my
first <i>perception</i> that was <i>distinct?</i> What
was there that seem’d not incident to every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
other Animal? But now when I distinguish
the Wax from its outward adherents,
and consider it as if it were naked,
with it’s coverings pull’d off, then
I cannot but really perceive it with my
mind, though yet perhaps my judgment
may erre.</p>

<p>But what shall I now say as to my
<i>mind</i>, or my <i>self</i>? (for as yet I admit nothing
as belonging to me but a <i>mind</i>.)
Why (shall I say?) should not I, who
seem to perceive this Wax so <i>distinctly</i>,
know my <i>self</i> not only more <i>truly</i> and
more <i>certainly</i>, but more <i>distinctly</i> and <i>evidently</i>?
For if I judge that <i>this Wax exists</i>,
because I <i>see</i> this Wax; surely it
will be much more <i>evident</i>, that I <i>my self
exist</i>, because <i>I see this Wax</i>; for it may
be that this that I see is not really Wax,
also it may be that I have no eyes
wherewith to see any thing; but it cannot
be, when I <i>see</i>, or (which is the same
thing) when <i>I think that I see</i>, that I who
<i>think</i> should not <i>exist</i>. The same thing
will follow if I <i>judge that this Wax exists</i>,
because I <i>touch</i>, or <i>imagine</i> it, &amp;c. And
what has been said of Wax, may be apply’d
to all other outward things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>Moreover, if the <i>notion</i> of Wax seems
more <i>distinct</i> after it is made known to me,
not only by my <i>sight</i> or <i>touch</i>, but by more
and other causes; How much the more
<i>distinctly</i> must I confess my <i>self known</i> unto
my <i>self</i>, seeing that all sort of reasoning
which furthers me in the <i>perception</i>
of <i>Wax</i>, or any other <i>Body</i>, does also encrease
the proofs of the <i>nature</i> of my
<i>Mind</i>. But there are so many more
things in the very <i>Mind</i> it self, by which
the <i>notion</i> of it may be made more <i>distinct</i>,
that those things which drawn from
<i>Body</i> conduce to its knowledge are scarce
to be <i>mention’d</i>.</p>

<p>And now behold of my own accord
am I come to the place I would be in;
for seeing I have now discover’d that <i>Bodies
themselves</i> are not <i>properly perceived</i>
by our <i>senses</i> or <i>imagination</i>, but only by
our <i>understanding</i>, and are not therefore
<i>perceived</i>, because they are <i>felt</i> or <i>seen</i>,
but because they are <i>understood</i>; it plainly
appears to me, that nothing can possibly
be <i>perceived</i> by <i>me easier</i>, or more <i>evidently</i>,
than my <i>Mind</i>.</p>

<p>But because I cannot so soon shake off
the Acquaintance of my former Opinion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
I am willing to stop here, that this my
new knowledge may be better fixt in my
memory the longer I meditate thereon.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Meditat_III"><span class="smcap">Meditat. III.</span><br>
<i class="smaller">Of GOD, and that there is a God.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Now will I shut my eyes, I will stop
my ears, and withdraw all my senses,
I will blot out the Images of <i>corporeal</i>
things clearly from my mind, or (because
that can scarce be accomplish’d) I will
give no heed to them, as being <i>vain</i> and
<i>false</i>, and by discoursing with my self,
and prying more rightly into my own
Nature, will endeavour to make my self
by degrees more known and familiar to
my self.</p>

<p>I am a <i>Thinking Thing</i>, that is to say,
<i>doubting</i>, <i>affirming</i>, <i>denying</i>, <i>understanding</i>
few things, <i>ignorant</i> of many things, <i>willing</i>,
<i>nilling</i>, <i>imagining</i> also, and <i>sensitive</i>.
For (as before I have noted) though perhaps
whatever I <i>imagine</i>, or am sensible
of, as without me, <i>Is not</i>; yet that <i>manner</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
of <i>thinking</i> which I call <i>sense</i> and <i>imagination</i>
(as they are only certain <i>Modes</i> of
<i>Thinking</i>) I am certain are in Me. So
that in these few Words I have mention’d
whatever I <i>know</i>, or at least Whatever as
yet I <i>perceive</i> my self to <i>know</i>.</p>

<p>Now will I look about me more carefully
to see Whether there Be not some
other Thing in Me, of Which I have not
yet taken Notice. I am sure That I am a
<i>Thinking Thing</i>, and therefore Do not I
know what is Required to make <i>certain</i>
of any Thing? I Answer, that in this My
<i>first knowledge</i> ’tis Nothing but a <i>clear</i>, and
<i>distinct perception</i> of What I affirm, Which
would not be sufficient to make me <i>certain</i>
of the <i>Truth</i> of a Thing, if it were
<i>Possible</i> that any thing that I so <i>clearly</i> and
<i>distinctly</i> Perceive should be <i>false</i>. Wherefore
I may lay this Down as a <i>Principle</i>.
<i>Whatever I Clearly and Distinctly perceive is
certainly True.</i></p>

<p>But I have formerly Admitted of many
Things as very <i>Certain</i> and <i>manifest</i>,
Which I afterwards found to be <i>doubtful</i>.
Therefore What sort of Things were
they? <i>Viz.</i> Heaven, Earth, Stars, and all
other things which I perceived by my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
<i>Senses</i>. But What did I Perceive of These
<i>Clearly? Viz.</i> That I had the <i>Ideas</i> or
<i>Thoughts</i> of these things in my mind, and
at Present I cannot deny that I have these
<i>Ideas</i> in Me. But there was some other
thing Which I affirm’d, and Which (by
Reason of the common Way of Belief) I
thought that I <i>Clearly</i> Perceived; Which
nevertheless, I did not really Perceive;
And that was, that there were Certain
Things <i>Without Me</i> from whence these <i>Ideas
Proceeded</i>, and to which they were
exactly like. And this it was, Wherein I
was either <i>Deceived</i>, or if by Chance I
Judged <i>truly</i>, yet it Proceeded not from
the strength of my <i>Perception</i>.</p>

<p>But When I was exercised about any
single and easie Proposition in Arithmetick
or Geometry, as that two and three
added make five, Did not I Perceive them
<i>Clearly</i> enough to make me affirm them
True? Truly concerning these I had no
other Reason afterwards to <i>Doubt</i>, but
That I thought Perhaps there may be a
<i>God</i> who might have so created me, that I
should be <i>Deceived</i> even in those things
which seem’d most <i>Clear</i> to me. And as
often as this Pre-conceived opinion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
<i>Gods great Power</i> comes into my Mind, I
cannot but Confess that he may easily
cause me to Err even in those things which
I Think I perceive most <i>Evidently</i> with my
Mind; yet as often as I Consider the
Things themselves, which I Judge my
self to perceive so <i>Clearly</i>, I am so fully
Perswaded by them, that I easily Break
out into these Expressions, Let Who can
Deceive Me, yet he shall never Cause me
<i>Not to Be</i> whilst <i>I think that I Am</i>, or that
it shall ever be True, <i>that I never was</i>,
Whilst at Present ’tis True <i>that I am</i>, or
Perhaps, that Two and Three added make
More or Less then Five; for in These
things I Percieve a Manifest Repugnancy;
And truely seeing I have no reason to
Think any <i>God</i> a <i>Deceiver</i>, Nor as yet fully
know Whether there Be <i>any God</i>, or
<i>Not</i>, ’Tis but a slight and (as I may say)
Metaphysical Reason of Doubt, which depends
only on that opinion of which I am
not yet Perswaded.</p>

<p>Wherefore That this Hindrance may be
taken away, When I have time I ought to
Enquire, Whether there <i>Be a God</i>, And if
there be One, Whether he can be a <i>Deceiver</i>,
For whilst I am <i>Ignorant</i> of this, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
cannot possibly be fully <i>Certain</i> of any Other
thing.</p>

<p>But now Method seems to Require Me
to Rank all My Thoughts under certain
Heads, and to search in Which of them
<i>Truth</i> or <i>Falshood</i> properly Consists. Some
of them are (as it were) the <i>Images</i> of
Things, and to these alone the Name of
an <i>Idea</i> properly belongs, as When I think
upon a Man, A Chimera or Monster, Heaven,
an Angel, or <i>God</i>. But there are others
of them, that have <i>superadded Forms</i>
to them, as when I Will, when I Fear,
when I Affirm, when I Deny. I know I
have alwayes (when ever I think) some
certain Thing as the <i>subject</i> or <i>object</i> of my
Thought, but in this last sort of thoughts
there is something <i>more</i> which I Think upon
then Barely the likeness of the Thing.
And of these Thoughts some are called
<i>Wills</i> and <i>Affections</i>, and Others of them
<i>Judgments</i>.</p>

<p>Now as touching <i>Ideas</i>, if they be Consider’d
alone as they are in themselves,
without <i>Respect</i> to any other Things, they
cannot Properly be <i>false</i>; for Whether I
<i>Imagine</i> a Goat or a Chimera, ’tis as <i>Certain</i>
that I <i>Imagine</i> one as t’other. Also in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
the <i>Will</i> and <i>Affections</i> I need not Fear any
<i>Falshood</i>, For tho I should <i>Wish</i> for <i>evil
Things</i>, or Things that are Not, it is
not therefore <i>Not true</i> that I Wish for
them.</p>

<p>Wherefore there onely Remains my
<i>Judgments</i> of Things, in which I must
take Care that I be not <i>deceived</i>. Now
the Chief and most usual <i>Error</i> that I discover
in them is, That I <i>Judge</i> Those <i>Ideas</i>
that are <i>within</i> me to be <i>Conformable</i> and
like to certain things that are <i>without</i> Me;
for truely if I Consider those Ideas as certain
<i>Modes</i> of my <i>Thought</i>, without Respect
to any other Thing, they will scarce
afford me an Occasion of <i>Erring</i>.</p>

<p>Of these <i>Ideas</i> some are <i>Innate</i>, some
<i>Adventitious</i>, and some Others seem to Me
as Created by my self; For that I understand
what <i>A Thing</i> Is, What is <i>Truth</i>,
What a <i>Thought</i>, seems to Proceed meerly
from my own <i>Nature</i>. But that I now
<i>hear</i> a Noise, <i>see</i> the Sun, or <i>feel</i> heat, <i>I</i>
have alwayes <i>Judged</i> to Proceed from
Things <i>External</i>. But Lastly, Mermaids,
Griffins, and such like Monsters, are <i>made
meerly</i> by <i>My self</i>. And yet <i>I</i> may well
think all of them either <i>Adventitious</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
or all of them <i>Innate</i>, or all of them <i>made
by my self</i>, for I have not as yet discover’d
their true <i>Original</i>.</p>

<p>But <i>I</i> ought cheifly to search after those
of them which <i>I</i> count <i>Adventitious</i>, and
which I consider as coming from <i>outward
objects</i>, that I may know what reason I
have to think them <i>like</i> the things themselves,
which they <i>represent</i>. Viz. <i>Nature
so teaches Me</i>; and also I know that
they <i>depend</i> not on my <i>Will</i>, and therefore
<i>not on me</i>; for they are often present
with me against my inclinations,
or (as they say) in spite of my teeth,
as now whether <i>I will</i> or <i>no</i> I feel heat,
and therefore I think that the <i>sense</i> or <i>Idea</i>
of heat is propagated to me by a <i>thing</i> really
<i>distinct</i> from <i>my self</i>, and that is by
the <i>heat</i> of the <i>Fire</i> at which I sit; And
nothing is more obvious then for me to
judge that That thing should transmit its
own <i>Likeness</i> into me, rather then that
any other thing should be transmitted by
it. Which sort of arguments whether
firme enough or not I shall now Trie.</p>

<p>When I here say, that <i>nature so teaches
me</i>, I understand only, that I am as it
were <i>willingly forced</i> to beleive it, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
not that ’tis <i>discover’d</i> to me to be <i>true</i>
by any <i>natural light</i>; for these two differ
very much. For whatever is discover’d
to me by the <i>Light</i> of <i>nature</i> (as that it
necessarily Follows <i>that I am</i>, because <i>I
think</i>) cannot possibly be <i>doubted</i>; Because
I am endowed with no other <i>Faculty</i>,
in which I may put so great confidence,
as I can in the <i>Light</i> of <i>nature</i>; or
<i>which</i> can possibly tell me, that those
things are <i>false</i>, which <i>natural light</i> teaches
me to be <i>true</i>; and as to my <i>natural
Inclinations</i>, I have heretofore often
judged my self led by them to the election
of the <i>worst part</i>, when I was in the
choosing <i>one</i> of two Goods; and therefore
I see no reason why I should ever <i>trust</i>
them in any other thing.</p>

<p>And then, tho these <i>Ideas depend not</i>
on my <i>will</i>, it does not therefore follow
that they <i>necessarily proceed</i> from <i>things
external</i>. For as, Altho those <i>Inclinations</i>
(which I but now mention’d) are in
me, yet they seem <i>distinct</i> and <i>different</i>
from my <i>will</i>; so perhaps there may be
in me some other <i>faculty</i> (to me <i>unknown</i>)
which may prove the <i>Efficient cause</i> of
these <i>Ideas</i>, as hitherto I have observed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
them to be formed in me whilst I <i>dream</i>,
without the help of any <i>External Object</i>.</p>

<p>And last of all, tho they should <i>proceed</i>
from things which are <i>different</i> from
me, it does not therefore follow that they
must be <i>like</i> those things. For often times
I have found the <i>thing</i> and the <i>Idea differing</i>
much. As for example, I find in
my self two divers <i>Ideas</i> of the Sun, <i>one</i>
as <i>received</i> by my <i>senses</i> (and which cheifly
I reckon among those I call adventitious)
by which it appears to me very <i>smal</i>,
<a href="#note6" id="anchor1">*</a> <i>another</i> as taken from the arguments of
Astronomers (that is to say, <i>consequentially
collected</i>, or some other ways made by me
from certain <i>natural notions</i>) by which
’tis rendred something bigger then the
Globe of the Earth. Certainly both of
these cannot be <i>like</i> that sun which is <i>without
me</i>, and my reason perswades me, that
that <i>Idea</i> is most <i>unlike</i> the Sun, which
seems to <i>proceed Immediately</i> from it
self.</p>

<p>All which things sufficiently prove, that
I have hitherto (not from a <i>true judgement</i>,
but from a <i>blind impulse</i>) beleived that
there are certain things <i>different</i> from my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
self, and which have sent their <i>Ideas</i> or
<i>Images</i> into me by the Organs of my <i>senses</i>,
or some other way.</p>

<p>But I have yet an other Way of inquiring,
whether any of those Things
(whose <i>Ideas</i> I have <i>within</i> Me) are Really
Existent <i>without</i> Me; And that is Thus:
As those <i>Ideas</i> are only <i>Modes</i> of <i>Thinking</i>,
I acknowledge no <i>Inequality</i> between
them, and they all proceed from me in
the <i>same Manner</i>. But as <i>one</i> Represents
<i>one thing</i>, an <i>other</i>, an <i>other Thing</i>, ’tis Evident
there is a <i>Great difference</i> between
them. <a href="#note7" id="anchor2">*</a> For without doubt, Those of them
which Represent <i>Substances</i> are something
<i>More</i>, or (as I may say) have <i>More</i> of <i>Objective
Reallity</i> in them, then those that Represent
only <i>Modes</i> or <i>Accidents</i>; and again, <i>That</i>
by Which I understand a <i>Mighty God</i>, <i>Eternal</i>,
<i>Infinite</i>, <i>Omniscient</i>, <i>Omnipotent
Creatour</i> of all things besides himself, has
certainly in it <i>more Objective Reallity</i>, then
Those <i>Ideas</i> by which <i>Finite Substances</i> are
Exhibited.</p>

<p>But Now, it is evident by the <i>Light</i> of
<i>Nature</i> that there must be <i>as much</i> at least
in the <i>Total efficient Cause</i>, as there is in
the <i>Effect</i> of <i>that Cause</i>; For from Whence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
can the <i>effect</i> have its <i>Reallity</i>, but from the
<i>Cause</i>? and how can the <i>Cause</i> give it that
<i>Reallity</i>, unless <i>it self have</i> it?</p>

<p>And from hence it follows, that neither
a <i>Thing</i> can be made out of <i>Nothing</i>,
Neither a Thing which is <i>more Perfect</i>
(that is, Which has in it self <i>more Reallity</i>)
<i>proceed</i> from That Which is <i>Less Perfect</i>.</p>

<p>And this is <i>Clearly</i> True, not only in
those <i>Effects</i> whose <i>Actual</i> or <i>Formal Reallity</i>
is Consider’d, But in Those <i>Ideas</i> also,
Whose <i>Objective Reallity</i> is only Respected;
That is to say, for Example of Illustration,
it is not only impossible that a stone,
Which <i>was not</i>, should now begin <i>to Be</i>,
unless it were produced by <i>something</i>, in
Which, Whatever goes to the Making a
Stone, is either <i>Formally</i> or <i>Virtually</i>; neither
can <i>heat</i> be Produced in any Thing,
which before was <i>not hot</i>, but by a Thing
which is at least of as equal a <i>degree</i> of
<i>Perfection</i> as <i>heat</i> is; But also ’tis Impossible
that I should have an <i>Idea</i> of Heat,
or of a <i>Stone</i>, unless it were put into me
by some <i>Cause</i>, in which there is at Least
as much <i>Reallity</i>, as I Conceive there is in
heat or a Stone. For tho that <i>Cause</i> transfers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
none of its own <i>Actual</i> or <i>Formal Reality</i>
into my <i>Idea</i>, I must not from
thence conclude that ’tis <i>less real</i>; but I
may think that the <i>nature</i> of the <i>Idea</i> it
self is such, that of it self it requires no
other <i>formal reality</i>, but what it has from
my <i>thought</i>, of which ’tis a <i>mode</i>. But
that this Idea has <i>this</i> or <i>that objective reallity</i>,
rather then any <i>other</i>, proceeds
clearly from some <i>cause</i>, in which there
ought to be at least as much <i>formal reallity</i>,
as there is of <i>objective reallity</i> in the
<i>Idea</i> it self. For if we suppose any thing
in the <i>Idea</i>, which was not in its <i>cause</i>, it
must of necessity have this from <i>nothing</i>;
but (tho it be a most <i>Imperfect manner</i> of
<i>existing</i>, by which the thing is <i>objectively</i>
in the <i>Intellect</i> by an <i>Idea</i>, yet) it is not
<i>altogether nothing</i>, and therefore cannot
proceed from <i>nothing</i>.</p>

<p>Neither ought I to doubt, seeing the
<i>reallity</i> which I perceive in my <i>Ideas</i> is only
an <i>objective reallity</i>, that therefore it
must of necessity follow, that the same
<i>reallity</i> should be in the <i>causes</i> of these
<i>Ideas formally</i>. But I may conclude, that
’tis sufficient that this <i>reallity</i> be in the very
<i>causes</i> only <i>objectively</i>. For as that <i>objective<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
manner</i> of <i>being</i> appertains to the
very <i>nature</i> of an <i>Idea</i>, so that <i>formal manner</i>
of <i>being</i> appertains to the very <i>nature</i>
of a <i>cause</i> of <i>Ideas</i>, at least to the <i>first</i> and
<i>chiefest causes</i> of them; For tho perhaps
one <i>Idea</i> may receive its birth from an other,
yet we cannot proceed in <i>Infinitum</i>,
but at last we must arrive at some <i>first Idea</i>,
whose <i>cause</i> is (as it were) an <i>Original
copy</i>, in which all the <i>objective reallity</i> of
the <i>Idea</i> is <i>formally contain’d</i>. So that I
plainly discover by the <i>light</i> of <i>nature</i>, that
the <i>Ideas</i>, which are in me, are (as it
were) <i>Pictures</i>, which may easily <i>come
short</i> of the <i>perfection</i> of those things from
whence they are taken, but cannot <i>contain</i>
any thing <i>greater</i> or <i>more perfect</i> then
them: And the <i>longer</i> and <i>more diligently</i>
I pry into these things, so much the more
<i>clearly</i> and <i>distinctly</i> do I discover them
to be <i>true</i>.</p>

<p>But what shall I conclude from hence?
Thus, that if the <i>objective reallity</i> of any
of my <i>Ideas</i> be <i>such</i>, that it cannot be in
me either <i>formally</i> or <i>eminently</i>, and that
therefore I cannot be the <i>cause</i> of <i>that Idea</i>,
from hence it necessarily Follows, that <i>I
alone</i> do not only <i>exist</i>, but that some other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
thing, which is <i>cause</i> of that <i>Idea</i>,
does <i>exist also</i>.</p>

<p>But if I can find no <i>such Idea</i> in me, I
have no argument to perswade me of the
<i>existence</i> of any thing besides my self for
I have diligently enquired, and hitherto
I could discover no other <i>perswasive</i>.</p>

<p>Some of these <i>Ideas</i> there are (besides
that which represents <i>my self</i> to <i>my self</i>,
of which in this place I cannot doubt)
which represent to me, one of them a
<i>God</i>, others of them <i>Corporeal</i> and <i>Inanimate</i>
things, some of them <i>Angels</i>, others
<i>Animals</i>, and lastly some of them which
exhibite to me <i>men like my self</i>.</p>

<p>As touching those that represent <i>Men</i>
or <i>Angels</i> or <i>Animals</i>, I easily understand
that they may be <i>made up</i> of those <i>Ideas</i>
which I have of <i>my self</i>, of <i>Corporeal</i> things,
and of <i>God</i>, tho there were neither <i>man</i>
(but my self) nor <i>Angel</i>, nor <i>Animal</i> in
being.</p>

<p>And as to the <i>Ideas</i> of <i>Corporeal</i> things,
I find nothing in them of that <i>perfection</i>,
but it may proceed from my self; for if I
look into them more narrowly, and examine
them more particularly, as yesterday
(<i>in the second Medit.</i>) I did the <i>Idea</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
Wax, I find there are but few things
which I perceive <i>clearly</i> and <i>distinctly</i> in
them, viz. <i>Magnitude</i> or <i>extension</i> in
<i>Longitude</i>, <i>Latitude</i>, and <i>Profundity</i>, the
<i>Figure</i> or <i>shape</i> which arises from the <i>termination</i>
of that <i>Extension</i>, the <i>Position</i> or
<i>place</i> which divers <i>Figured Bodies</i> have
in <i>respect</i> of each other, their <i>motion</i> or
<i>change of place</i>; to which may be added,
their <i>substance</i>, <i>continuance</i>, and <i>number</i>;
as to the other, such as are, <i>Light</i>, <i>Colours</i>,
<i>Sounds</i>, <i>Smels</i>, <i>Tasts</i>, <i>Heat</i>, and
<i>Cold</i>, with the other <i>tactile qualities</i>, I
have but very <i>obscure</i> and <i>confused thoughts</i>
of them, so that I know not, whether
they are <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>, that is to say, whether
the <i>Ideas</i> I have of them are the <i>Ideas</i>
of <i>things</i> which <i>really are</i>, or <i>are not</i>. For
altho <i>falshood formally</i> and <i>properly</i> so called,
consists only in the <i>judgement</i> (as before
I have observed) yet there is an other
sort of <i>material falshood</i> in <i>Ideas</i>, when
they represent a <i>thing</i> as <i>really existent</i>,
tho it does <i>not exist</i>; so, for example,
the <i>Ideas</i> I have of <i>heat</i> and <i>cold</i> are so <i>obscure</i>
and <i>confused</i>, that I cannot collect
from them, whether <i>cold</i> be a <i>privation</i> of
<i>heat</i>, or <i>heat</i> a <i>privation</i> of <i>cold</i>, or whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
either of them be a <i>real quality</i>, or
whether neither of them be <i>real</i>. And
since every <i>Idea</i> must be <i>like</i> the thing it
represents, if it be <i>true</i> that <i>cold</i> is nothing
but the <i>privation</i> of <i>heat</i>, that <i>Idea</i>
which represents it to me as a thing <i>real</i>
and <i>positive</i> may deservedly be called
<i>false</i>. The same may be apply’d to other
Ideas.</p>

<p>And now I see no necessity why I
should assigne any other <i>Author</i> of these
<i>Ideas</i> but <i>my self</i>; for if they are <i>false</i>, that
is, represent things that <i>are not</i>, I know
by the <i>light</i> of <i>nature</i> that they proceed
from <i>nothing</i>; that is to say, I harbour
them upon no other account, but because
my <i>nature</i> is <i>deficient</i> in something, and
<i>imperfect</i>. But if they are <i>true</i>, yet seeing
I discover so little <i>reality</i> in them, that
that very <i>reality</i> scarce <i>seems</i> to <i>be realy</i>,
I see no reason why I my self should not be
the <i>Author</i> of them.</p>

<p>But also some of those very <i>Ideas</i> of <i>Corporeal</i>
things which are <i>clear</i> and <i>distinct</i>,
I may seem to have borrow’d from
the <i>Idea</i> I have of <i>my self</i>, viz. <i>Substance</i>,
<i>duration</i>, <i>number</i>, and the like; For
when I conceive a <i>stone</i> to be a <i>substance</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
(that is, <i>a thing apt of it self to exist</i>) and
also that I <i>my self</i> am a <i>substance</i>, tho I
conceive <i>my self</i> a <i>thinking substance</i> and
<i>not extended</i>, and the <i>stone</i> an <i>extended
substance</i> and <i>not thinking</i>, by which there
is a great <i>diversity</i> between both the <i>conceptions</i>,
yet they <i>agree</i> in this, that they
are <i>both substances</i>. So when I conceive
my self as <i>now</i> in being, and also remember,
that <i>heretofore</i> I <i>have been</i>; and since
I have <i>divers</i> thoughts, which I can <i>number</i>
or <i>count</i>; from hence it is that I
come by the notions of <i>duration</i> and
<i>number</i>; which afterwards I apply to other
things.</p>

<p>As to those other things, of which the
<i>Idea</i> of a <i>body</i> is made up, as <i>extension</i>,
<i>figure</i>, <i>place</i> and <i>motion</i>, they are not <i>formally</i>
in me, seeing I am only a <i>thinking
thing</i>; yet seeing they are only certain
<i>modes</i> of <i>substance</i>, and I my self also am
a <i>substance</i>, they may seem to be in me
<i>eminently</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#note8" id="anchor3">*</a> Wherefore there only Remains the <i>Idea</i>
of a <i>God</i>, wherein I must consider whether
there be not something included,
which cannot possibly have its <i>original</i>
from me. By the word <i>God</i>, I mean a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
certain <i>Infinite Substance</i>, <i>Independent</i>,
<i>Omniscient</i>, <i>Almighty</i>, by whom both <i>I
my self</i>, and every thing else that <i>is</i> (if any
thing do <i>Actualy exist</i>) was created. All
which <i>Attributes</i> are of such an <i>high nature</i>,
that the more attentively I consider
them, the less I conceive my self possible
to be the <i>Author</i> of these notions.</p>

<p>From what therefore has been said I
must conclude that there is a <i>God</i>; for
tho the <i>Idea</i> of <i>substance</i> may arise in me,
because that I my self am a <i>substance</i>, yet
I could not have the <i>Idea</i> of an <i>Infinite
substance</i> (seeing I my self am <i>finite</i>) unless
it proceeded from a <i>substance</i> which is <i>really
Infinite</i>. Neither ought I to think
that I have no <i>true Idea</i> of <i>Infinity</i>, or
that I perceive it only by the <i>negation</i> of
what is <i>finite</i>, as I conceive <i>rest</i> and <i>darkness</i>
by the <i>negation</i> or <i>absence</i> of <i>motion</i> or
<i>light</i>. But on the contrary I plainly understand,
that there is <i>more reality</i> in an
<i>Infinite substance</i>, then in a <i>Finite</i>; and
that therefore the <i>perception</i> of an <i>Infinite</i>
(as <i>God</i>) is <i>antecedent</i> to the <i>notion</i> I have
of a <i>finite</i> (as <i>my self</i>). For how should I
know that I <i>doubt</i> or <i>desire</i>, that is to say,
that I <i>want</i> something, and that I am <i>not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
altogether perfect</i>, unless I had the <i>Idea</i> of
a <i>being more perfect</i> then <i>my self</i>, by <i>comparing</i>
my self to which I may discover my
own <i>Imperfections</i>.</p>

<p>Neither can it be said that this <i>Idea</i> of
<i>God</i> is <i>false Materialiter</i>, and that therefore
it <i>proceeds</i> from <i>nothing</i>, as before I observed
of the <i>Ideas</i> of <i>heat</i> and <i>cold</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>
For on the contrary, seeing this <i>notion</i> is
most <i>clear</i> and <i>distinct</i>, and contains in it
self more <i>objective reality</i> then any other
<i>Idea</i>, none can be more <i>true</i> in it self,
nor in which less <i>suspition</i> of <i>falshood</i> can
be found. This <i>Idea</i> (I say) of a <i>being
infinitely perfect</i> is most <i>true</i>, for tho it may
be supposed that such a <i>being</i> does <i>not exist</i>,
yet it cannot be supposed that the <i>Idea</i>
of such a <i>being</i> exhibites to me nothing <i>real</i>,
as before I have said of the <i>Idea</i> of
<i>cold</i>. This <i>Idea</i> also is most <i>clear</i> and <i>distinct</i>,
for whatever I perceive <i>clearly</i> and
<i>distinctly</i> to be <i>real</i>, and <i>true</i>, and <i>perfect</i>,
is wholy <i>contain’d</i> in this <i>Idea</i> of <i>God</i>.</p>

<p>Neither can it be objected, that I cannot
<i>comprehend</i> an <i>Infinite</i>, or that there
are innumerable other things in <i>God</i>,
which I can neither <i>conceive</i>, nor in the
least <i>think upon</i>; for it is of the <i>very nature</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
of an <i>Infinite</i> not to be <i>apprehendable</i> by
<i>me</i> who am <i>finite</i>. And ’tis sufficient to
me to prove this my <i>Idea</i> of <i>God</i> to be the
most <i>true</i>, the most <i>clear</i>, and the most
<i>distinct Idea</i> of all those <i>Ideas</i> I have, upon
this <i>account</i>, that I understand that <i>God</i>
is <i>not to be understood</i>, and that I judge
that whatever I <i>clearly</i> perceive and know
<i>Implys</i> any <i>perfection</i>, as also perhaps other
innumerable <i>perfections</i>, which I am ignorant
of, are in <i>God</i> either <i>formally</i> or
<i>eminently</i>.</p>

<p><i>Doubt.</i> But perhaps <i>I am</i> something
<i>more</i> then I take my self to <i>be</i>, and perhaps
all these <i>perfections</i> which I attribute
to <i>God</i>, are <i>potentially</i> in me, tho at present
they do not shew themselves, and
break into action. For I am now fully
experienced that my <i>Knowledge</i> may be
<i>encreased</i>, and I see nothing that hinders
why it may not <i>encrease</i> by degrees in <i>Infinitum</i>,
nor why by my <i>knowledge</i> so <i>encreased</i>
I may not attain to the other <i>perfections</i>
of <i>God</i>; nor lastly, why the <i>power</i>
or <i>aptitude</i> of <i>having</i> these perfections
may not be sufficient to produce the <i>Idea</i>
of them in <i>me</i>.</p>

<p><i>Solution.</i> But none of these will do;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
for first, tho it be true that my <i>Knowledge</i>
is capable of being <i>increased</i>, and that
many things are in me <i>potentially</i>, which
<i>actually</i> are not, yet none of these go to
the making an <i>Idea</i> of <i>God</i>, in which I
conceive nothing <i>potentially</i>, for tis a certain
argument of <i>imperfection</i> that a thing
<i>may be encreased Gradually</i>. Moreover,
tho my knowledge may be <i>more</i> and <i>more
encreased</i>, yet I know that it can never
be <i>actually Infinite</i>, for it can never arrive
to that <i>height</i> of <i>perfection</i>, which admits
not of an <i>higher degree</i>. But I conceive
God to be <i>actually</i> so <i>Infinite</i>, that
nothing can be <i>added</i> to his <i>perfections</i>.
And lastly, I perceive that the <i>objective being</i>
of an <i>Idea</i> cannot be <i>produced</i> only by
the <i>potential being</i> of a <i>thing</i> (which in
proper speech is <i>nothing</i>) but requires an
<i>actual</i> or <i>formal being</i> to its <i>production</i>.</p>

<p>Of all which forementioned things
there is nothing that is not <i>evident</i> by the
<i>light</i> of <i>reason</i> to any one that will diligently
consider them. Yet because that
(when I am careless, and the <i>Images</i> of
<i>sensible</i> things <i>blind</i> my <i>understanding</i>) I
do not so easily call to mind the reasons,
why the <i>Idea</i> of a <i>being more perfect</i> then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
<i>my self</i> should of necessity proceed from a
<i>being</i> which is <i>really more perfect</i>; It will
be requisite to enquire further, whether
<i>I</i>, who have this <i>Idea</i>, can possibly <i>be</i>, unless
<i>such</i> a <i>being</i> did <i>exist</i>. To which end
let me aske, <i>from whence</i> should I <i>be</i>? From
<i>my self</i>? or from my <i>Parents</i>? or from
any other thing <i>less perfect</i> then <i>God</i>? for
nothing can be thought or supposed
<i>more perfect</i>, or <i>equally perfect</i> with <i>God</i>.</p>

<p>But first, If <i>I</i> were from my self, I should
neither <i>doubt</i>, nor <i>desire</i>, nor <i>want</i> any
thing, for I should have given my self all
those <i>perfections</i>, of which I have any <i>Idea</i>,
and consequently I my self should be
<i>God</i>; and I cannot think that those
things I <i>want</i>, are to be acquired with <i>greater
difficulty</i> then those things I <i>have</i>; but
on the contrary, ’tis manifest, that it were
much more <i>difficult</i> that <i>I</i> (that is, <i>a substance</i>
that <i>thinks</i>) should <i>arise</i> out of
<i>nothing</i>, then that I should <i>acquire</i> the
<i>knowledge</i> of many things whereof I am
<i>Ignorant</i>, which is only the <i>accident</i> of
that <i>substance</i>. And certainly if I had
that <i>greater thing</i> (viz <i>being</i>) from my
self, I should not have <i>denyed</i> my self (not
only, those things which may be easier acquired,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
but also) All those things, which I
perceived are contain’d in the <i>Idea</i> of a
<i>God</i>; and the reason is, for that no other
things <i>seem</i> to me to be <i>more difficultly</i>
done, and certainly if they were <i>Really
more difficult</i>, they would <i>seem</i> more <i>difficult</i>
to me (if whatever <i>I have</i>, I <i>have</i>
from my self) for in those things I should
find my <i>Power</i> put to a stop.</p>

<p>Neither can I Evade the force of these
Arguments by supposing my self to <i>have
alwaies Been, what now I am</i>, and that
therefore I need not seek for an <i>Author</i>
of my <i>Being</i>. For the <i>Duration</i> or <i>Continuance</i>
of my life may be <i>divided</i> into
<i>Innumerable Parts</i>, each of which does not
at all <i>depend</i> on the <i>Other Parts</i>; Therefore
it will not follow, that because <i>a while
ago, I was</i>, I must of necessity <i>now Be</i>. I
say, this will not follow, Unless, I suppose
some <i>Cause</i> to <i>Create me</i> (as it were)
<i>anew</i> for <i>this</i> Moment (that is, <i>Conserve me</i>).
For ’tis evident to one that Considers the
Nature of <i>Duration</i>, that the same <i>Power</i>
and <i>Action</i> is requisite to the <i>Conservation</i>
of a Thing each <i>Moment</i> of its <i>Being</i>, as
there is to the <i>Creation</i> of that Thing <i>anew</i>,
if it did <i>not exist</i>. So that ’tis one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
of those <i>Principles</i> which are <i>Evident</i> by
the <i>Light</i> of <i>Nature</i>: that the <i>Act</i> of <i>Conservation</i>
differs only <i>Ratione</i> (as the Philosophers
term it) from the <i>Act of Creation</i>.</p>

<p>Wherefore I ought to ask my self this
Question, whether <i>I</i>, who <i>now</i> Am; have
any <i>Power</i> to <i>Cause</i> my self to <i>Be hereafter</i>?
(for had I any such <i>power</i>, I should certainly
<i>know</i> of it, seeing I am nothing but a <i>Thinking
Thing</i>, or at least at present I onely
treat of that part of me, which is a <i>Thing</i>
that <i>Thinks</i>) to which, I answer, that I
can discover no such <i>Power</i> in Me; And
consequently, I evidently know that <i>I
depend</i> on some <i>Other being distinct</i> from
<i>my self</i>.</p>

<p>But what if <i>I</i> say that perhaps this <i>Being</i>
is not <i>God</i>, but that <i>I</i> am produced either
by my <i>Parents</i>, or some other <i>Causes
less perfect</i> then <i>God</i>? In answer to which
let me consider (as <i>I</i> have said before) that
’tis <i>manifest</i> that whatever is in the <i>effect,
so much</i> at least ought to be in the <i>cause</i>;
and therefore seeing <i>I</i> am a thing that
<i>thinks</i>, and have in me an <i>Idea</i> of <i>God</i>, it
will confessedly follow, that whatever
sort of <i>cause</i> I assign of my <i>own Being</i>, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
also must be a <i>Thinking Thing</i>, and must
have an <i>Idea</i> of all those <i>Perfections</i>, which
I attribute to <i>God</i>; Of which <i>Cause</i> it
may be again Asked, whether it be <i>from
it self</i>, or from any other <i>Cause</i>? If <i>from
it self</i>, ’tis evident (from what has been
said) that it must be <i>God</i>; For seeing it
has the <i>Power</i> of <i>Existing of it self</i>, without
doubt it has also the <i>power</i> of <i>actually
Possessing</i> all those <i>Perfections</i> whereof it
has an <i>Idea</i> in it self, that is, all those <i>Perfections</i>
which I conceive in <i>God</i>. But if
it Be from an <i>other Cause</i>, it may again be
asked of that <i>Cause</i> whether it be <i>of it
self</i>, or from an <i>other</i>; Till at length We
arrive at the <i>Last Cause</i> of All, Which
will Be <i>God</i>. For ’tis evident, that this
<i>Enquiry</i> will not admit of <i>Progressus in
Infinitum</i>, especially when at Present I
treat not only of that Cause which at <i>first
made</i> Me; But chiefly of that which <i>conserves</i>
me in this <i>Instant</i> time.</p>

<p>Neither can it be supposed that many
<i>partial Causes</i> have <i>concurred</i> to the
making Me, and that I received the <i>Idea</i>
of one of <i>Gods perfections</i> from <i>One</i> of
them, and from an <i>other</i> of them the
<i>Idea</i> of an <i>other</i>; and that therefore all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
these Perfections are to be found <i>scattered</i>
in the World, but not all of them <i>Joyn’d</i>
in any one which may Be <i>God</i>. For on
the contrary, <i>Unity</i>, <i>Simplicity</i>, or the <i>inseparability</i>
of All Gods Attributes is one
of the <i>chief Perfections</i> which I conceive
in Him; and certainly the <i>Idea</i> of the
<i>Unity</i> of the <i>Divine Perfections</i> could not
be <i>created</i> in me by any other <i>cause</i>, then
by <i>That</i>, from whence I have received the
<i>Ideas</i> of his other <i>perfections</i>; For ’tis Impossible
to make me conceive these <i>perfections</i>,
<i>conjunct</i> and <i>inseparable</i>, unless he
should also make me know what <i>perfections</i>
these <i>are</i>.</p>

<p>Lastly as touching my <i>having</i> my <i>Being</i>
from my <i>Parents</i>. Tho whatever
Thoughts I have heretofore harbour’d of
Them were <i>True</i>, yet certainly they <i>contribute</i>
nothing to my <i>conservation</i>, neither
proceed I from them as <i>I am</i> a <i>Thing</i> that
<i>Thinks</i>, for they have onely <i>predisposed</i>
that <i>material Thing</i>, wherein <i>I</i>, that is, <i>my
mind</i> (<i>which</i> only at present I take for
<i>my self</i>) <i>Inhabits</i>. Wherefore I cannot
<i>now</i> Question that I am sprung from them.
But I must of necessity conclude that because
<i>I am</i>, and because I have an <i>Idea</i> of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
<i>Being most perfect</i>, that is, of <i>God</i>, it evidently
follows that <i>there is a God</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#note5" id="anchor4">*</a> Now it only remains for me to examine,
how I have received this <i>Idea</i> of
<i>God</i>. For I have neither received it by
<i>means</i> of <i>my Senses</i>, neither comes it to
me <i>without</i> my <i>Forethought</i>, as the <i>Ideas</i> of
<i>sensible</i> things use to do, when such things
<i>Work</i> on the Organs of my <i>Sense</i>, or at
least <i>seem</i> so to work; Neither is this <i>Idea</i>
framed by <i>my self</i>, for I can neither
<i>detract from</i>, nor <i>add</i> any thing <i>thereto</i>.
Wherefore I have only to conclude that
it is <i>Innate</i>, even as the <i>Idea</i> of me <i>my self</i>
is <i>Natural</i> to my self.</p>

<p>And truly ’tis not to be Admired that
<i>God</i> in Creating me should <i>Imprint</i> this <i>Idea</i>
in me, that it may there remain as a <i>stamp
impressed</i> by the <i>Workman God</i> on <i>me</i> his
<i>Work</i>, neither is it requisite that this
<i>stamp</i> should be a Thing <i>different</i> from
the <i>Work</i> it self, but ’tis very Credible
(from hence only that <i>God Created</i> me)
that I am made as it were according to
his <i>likeness</i> and <i>Image</i>, and that the same
<i>likeness</i>, in which the <i>Idea</i> of God is contain’d,
is <i>perceived</i> by Me with the <i>same
faculty</i>, with which I <i>perceive my Self</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
That is to say, whilst <i>I reflect</i> upon my
self, <i>I</i> do not only <i>perceive</i> that I am
an <i>Imperfect</i> thing, having my <i>dependance</i>
upon some other thing, and that I am a
Thing that Desires <i>more</i> and <i>better</i> things
<i>Indefinitely</i>; But also at the same time I
understand, that <i>He</i> on whom I <i>depend</i>
contains in him all those <i>wish’d for things</i>
(not only <i>Indefinitely</i> and <i>Potentially</i>, but)
<i>Really</i>, <i>Indefinitely</i>; and that therefore he is
<i>God</i>. The whole stress of which <a href="#note9" id="anchor5">*</a> Argument
lies thus, because I know it Impossible
for Me to Be of the same Nature I am,
<i>Viz.</i> Having the <i>Idea</i> of a <i>God</i> in me, unless
really there were a <i>God</i>, a <i>God</i> (I say)
that very <i>same God</i>, whose <i>Idea I</i> have in
my <i>Mind</i> (that is, Having all those <i>perfections</i>,
which I cannot <i>comprehend</i>, but
can as it were <i>think upon them</i>) and who
is not <i>subject</i> to any <i>Defects</i>.</p>

<p>By which ’tis evident that <i>God</i> is no
<i>Deceiver</i>; for ’tis manifest by the <i>Light</i>
of <i>Nature</i>, that all <i>fraud</i> and <i>deceit</i> depends
on some <i>defect</i>. But before I prosecute
this any farther, or pry into other
<i>Truthes</i> which may be deduced from this,
I am willing here to stop, and dwell upon
the Contemplation of this <i>God</i>, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
Consider with my self His <i>Divine Attributes</i>,
to behold, admire, and adore the
Loveliness of this <i>Immense light</i>, as much
as possibly I am able to accomplish with
my <i>dark</i> Understanding. For as by <i>Faith</i>
we <i>believe</i> that the greatest <i>happiness</i> of
the <i>next Life</i> consists alone in the <i>Contemplation</i>
of the <i>Divine Majesty</i>, so we <i>find</i>
by <i>Experience</i> that now we receive from
thence the greatest <i>pleasure</i>, whereof we
are capable in <i>this Life</i>; Tho it be
much more <i>Imperfect</i> then that in the <i>Next</i>.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Meditat_IV"><span class="smcap">Meditat. IV.</span><br>
<i class="smaller">Of Truth and Falshood.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Of late it has been so common with
me to withdraw <i>my Mind</i> from
my <i>sences</i>, and I have so throughly consider’d
how few things there are appertaining
to <i>Bodies</i> that are <i>truly</i> perceived,
and that there are more Things touching
<i>Mans mind</i>, and yet more concerning
<i>God</i>, which are <i>well known</i>; that now
without any difficulty <i>I</i> can turn my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
Thoughts from things <i>sensible</i>, to those
which are only <i>Intelligible</i>, and <i>Abstracted</i>
from <i>Matter</i>. And truely <i>I</i> have a
much more <i>distinct Idea</i> of a <i>Mans mind</i>
(as it is a <i>Thinking Thing</i>, having no <i>Corporeal
Dimensions</i> of <i>Length</i>, <i>Breadth</i>, and
<i>Thickness</i>, nor having any other <i>Corporeal
Quality</i>) then the <i>Idea</i> of any <i>Corporeal
Thing</i> can be. And when I reflect upon my
self, and consider how that I <i>doubt</i>, that is,
am an <i>imperfect dependent Being</i>, I from hence
Collect such a <i>clear</i> and <i>distinct Idea</i> of an
<i>Independent perfect Being</i>, which is <i>God</i>,
and from hence only that <i>I have such an
Idea</i>, that is, because <i>I</i> that have this <i>Idea</i>
do <i>my self Exist</i>; I do so <i>clearly</i> conclude
that <i>God also Exists</i>, and that on him my
<i>Being depends</i> each Minute; That I am Confident
nothing can be known more <i>Evidently</i>
and <i>Certainly</i> by <i>Humane Understanding</i>.</p>

<p>And now <i>I</i> seem to perceive a <i>Method</i>
by which, (from this Contemplation of
the <i>true God</i>, in whom the Treasures of
<i>Knowledge</i> and <i>Wisdome</i> are Hidden) <i>I</i>
may attain the <i>Knowledge</i> of other Things.</p>

<p>And first, <i>I</i> know ’tis impossible that
this <i>God</i> should <i>deceive</i> me; For in all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
<i>cheating</i> and <i>deceipt</i> there is something of
<i>imperfection</i>; and tho to be <i>able</i> to <i>deceive</i>
may seem to be an Argument of <i>ingenuity</i>
and <i>power</i>, yet without doubt to <i>have</i> the
<i>Will</i> of <i>deceiving</i> is a sign of <i>Malice</i> and
<i>Weakness</i>, and therefore is not <i>Incident</i> to
<i>God</i>.</p>

<p>I have also found in my self a <i>Judicative
faculty</i>, which certainly (as all other
things I possess) I have received from <i>God</i>;
and seeing he will not <i>deceive</i> me, he has
surely given me such a <i>Judgement</i>, that I
can <i>never Err</i>, whilst I make a <i>Right Use</i>
of it. Of which truth I can make no
doubt, unless it seems, that From hence
it will follow, That therefore <i>I can never
Err</i>; for if whatever I have, I have
from <i>God</i>, and if he gave me no <i>Faculty</i>
of <i>Erring</i>, I may seem not to be <i>able to Err</i>.
And truly so it is whilst I think upon <i>God</i>,
and wholly convert my self to the <i>consideration</i>
of him, I find no occasion of <i>Error</i>
or <i>Deceit</i>; but yet when I return to
the <i>Contemplation</i> of <i>my self</i>, I find my self
liable to <i>Innumerable Errors</i>. Enquiring
into the <i>cause</i> of which, I find in my self
an <i>Idea</i>, not only a <i>real</i> and <i>positive one</i> of
a <i>God</i>, that is, of a <i>Being infinitely perfect</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
but also (as I may so speak) a <i>Negative Idea</i>
of <i>Nothing</i>; that is to say, I am so
constituted between God and Nothing
or between a perfect <i>Being</i> and <i>No-being</i>,
that as I am <i>Created</i> by the <i>Highest Being</i>,
I have nothing in Me by which I may be
<i>deceived</i> or drawn into <i>Error</i>; but as I
pertake in a manner of <i>Nothing</i>, or of a
<i>No-Being</i>, that is, as I my self am <i>not</i> the <i>Highest
Being</i>, and as I <i>want</i> many <i>perfections</i>,
’tis no Wonder that I should be <i>Deceived</i>.</p>

<p>By which I understand that <i>Error</i> <a href="#note10" id="anchor6">*</a> (as
it is <i>Error</i>) is not any <i>real Being</i> dependant
on <i>God</i>, but it is only a <i>Defect</i>; And
that therefore to make me <i>Err</i> there
is not requisite a <i>faculty</i> of <i>Erring</i> given
me by <i>God</i>, but only it so happens that I
<i>Err</i> meerly because the <i>Judicative faculty</i>,
which he has given me, is not <i>Infinite</i>.</p>

<p>But yet this Account is not fully <i>satisfactory</i>;
for <i>Error</i> is not only a meer <i>Negation</i>,
but ’tis a <i>Privation</i>, or a <i>want</i> of a
certain <i>Knowledge</i>, which <i>ought</i> (as it were)
to be in me. And when I consider the
<i>Nature</i> of <i>God</i>, it seems impossible that
he should give me any <i>faculty</i> which is
not <i>perfect</i> in its <i>kind</i>, or which should
<i>want</i> any of its <i>due perfections</i>; for if by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
how much the more <i>skilful</i> the <i>Workman</i>
is, by so much the <i>Perfecter Works</i> proceed
from him. What can be made by the <i>Great
Maker</i> of all things which is not <i>fully perfect</i>?
For I cannot Doubt but <i>God</i> may
<i>Create</i> me so that I may <i>never</i> be <i>deceived</i>,
neither can I doubt but that he <i>Wills</i>
whatever is <i>Best</i>; Is it therefore <i>better</i> for
me to be <i>deceived</i>, or not to be <i>deceived?</i></p>

<p>These things when I Consider more
heedfully, it comes into my Mind, First,
that ’tis no cause of Admiration that <i>God</i>
should do Things whereof I can give no
account, nor must I therefore doubt his
<i>Being</i>, because there are many things
done by him, and I not comprehend
<i>Why</i> or <i>How</i> they are done; for seeing I
now know that my <i>Nature</i> is very <i>Weak</i>
and <i>Finite</i>, and that the <i>Nature</i> of <i>God</i> is
<i>Immense</i>, <i>Incomprehensible</i>, <i>Infinite</i>; from
hence I must fully, understand, that he can
do numberless things, the <i>Causes</i> whereof
lie <i>hidden</i> to Me. Upon which account
only I esteem all those Causes which are
Drawn from the End (viz. <i>Final Causes</i>)
as of no use in <i>Natural Philosophy</i>, for
I cannot without Rashness Think my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
self <i>able</i> to Discover <i>Gods</i> Designes.</p>

<p>I perceive this also, that whenever we
endeavour to know whether the <i>Works</i>
of <i>God</i> are <i>perfect</i>, we must not Respect
any <i>one kind</i> of Creature <i>singly</i>, but the
<i>Whole Universe</i> of <i>Beings</i>; for perhaps
what (if considered <i>alone</i>) may Deservedly
seem <i>Imperfect</i>, yet (as it is a <i>part</i> of
the <i>World</i>) is most <i>perfect</i>; and tho since
I have <i>doubted</i> of all things, I have discover’d
nothing <i>certainly</i> to <i>Exist</i>, but
<i>my self</i>, and <i>God</i>, yet since I have Consider’d
the <i>Omnipotency</i> of <i>God</i>, I cannot deny,
but that many other things <i>are made</i>
(or at least, <i>may be made</i>) by him, so that
I my self <i>may be</i> a <i>part</i> of this <i>Universe</i>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, coming nigher to my self,
and enquiring what these <i>Errors</i> of mine,
are (which are the Only Arguments of
my <i>Imperfection</i>) * I find them to <i>depend</i> on
<i>two concurring Causes</i>, on my <i>faculty</i> of
<i>Knowing</i>, and on my <i>faculty</i> of <i>Choosing</i>
or <i>Freedome</i> of my <i>Will</i>, that is to say,
from my <i>Understanding</i>, and my <i>Will together</i>.
For by my <i>Understanding alone</i> I
only perceive <i>Ideas</i>, whereon I make
<i>Judgments</i>, wherein (<i>precisely</i> so taken)
there can be no <i>Error, properly</i> so called;
for tho perhaps there may be numberless
things, whose <i>Ideas</i> I have <i>not</i> in Me, yet I
am not <i>properly</i> to be said <i>Deprived</i> of them,
but only <i>negatively wanting</i> them; and I
cannot prove that <i>God ought</i> to have given
me a <i>greater faculty</i> of <i>Knowing</i>. And
tho I understand him to be a <i>skilful Workman</i>,
yet I cannot Think, that he <i>ought</i> to
have put all those <i>perfections</i> in <i>each</i> Work
of his <i>singly</i>, with which he might have
<i>endowed some</i> of them.</p>

<p>Neither can I complain that <i>God</i> has
not given me a <i>Will</i>, or <i>Freedom</i> of <i>Choise</i>,
<i>large</i> and <i>perfect</i> enough; for I have experienced
that ’tis <i>Circumscribed</i> by <i>no
Bounds</i>.</p>

<p>And ’tis worth our taking notice, that
I have no other thing in me so <i>perfect</i> and
so <i>Great</i>, but I Understand that there may
be <i>Perfecter</i> and <i>Greater</i>, for if (for Example)
I consider the <i>Faculty</i> of <i>Understanding</i>,
I presently perceive that in me ’tis very
<i>small</i> and <i>Finite</i>, and also at the same
time I form to my self an <i>Idea</i> of an other
<i>Understanding</i> not only <i>much Greater</i>, but
the <i>Greatest</i> and <i>Infinite</i>, which I perceive
to belong to <i>God</i>. In the same manner if
I enquire into <i>memory</i> or <i>imagination</i> or any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]<br><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
other faculties, I find them in my self
<i>Weak</i> and <i>Circumscribed</i>, but in <i>God</i> I Understand
them to be <i>Infinite</i>, there is therefore
only my <i>Will</i> or <i>Freedome</i> of <i>Choice</i>,
which I find to be <i>so Great</i>, that I cannot
frame to my self an <i>Idea</i> of <i>One Greater</i>,
so that ’tis by this <i>chiefly</i> by which I Understand
my self to Bear the <i>likeness</i> and <i>Image</i>
of <i>God</i>. For tho the <i>Will</i> in <i>God</i>
be without comparison <i>Greater</i> then Mine,
both as to the <i>Knowledge</i> and <i>Power</i> which
are <i>Joyn’d</i> therewith, which make it more
<i>strong</i> and <i>Effective</i>, and also as to the <i>Object</i>
thereof, for <i>God</i> can apply himself to
<i>more</i> things then I can. Yet being taken
<i>Formally</i> and <i>Precisely Gods Will</i> seems <i>no
greater</i> then Mine. For the <i>Freedome</i> of
<i>Will</i> consists only in this, that we can <i>Do</i>,
or <i>not Do</i> such a Thing (that is, <i>affirm</i> or <i>deny</i>,
<i>prosecute</i> or <i>avoid</i>) or rather in this Only,
that we are <i>so carried</i> to a Thing which is
<i>proposed</i> by Our <i>Intellect</i> to <i>Affirm</i> or <i>Deny</i>,
<i>Prosecute</i> or <i>Shun</i>, that we are <i>sensible</i>,
that we are <i>not Determin’d</i> to the <i>Choice</i>
or <i>Aversion</i> thereof, by any <i>outward Force</i>.</p>

<p>Neither is it Requisite to make one <i>Free</i>
that he should have an <i>Inclination</i> to <i>both</i>
sides. For on the contrary, by how much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
the more <i>strongly</i> I am inclined to <i>one</i> side
(whether it be that I <i>evidently perceive</i>
therein Good or Evil, or Whether it be
that <i>God has so disposed</i> my <i>Inward Thoughts</i>)
By so much the <i>more Free</i> am I in my
<i>Choice</i>.</p>

<p>Neither truly do <i>Gods Grace</i> or <i>Natural
Knowledge</i> take away from my <i>Liberty</i>,
but rather <i>encrease</i> and <i>strengthen</i> it. For
that <i>indifference</i> which I find in my self,
when no Reason inclines me <i>more</i> to <i>one
side</i>, then to <i>the other</i>, is the <i>meanest</i> sort of
<i>Liberty</i>, and is so far from being a sign of
<i>perfection</i>, that it only argues a <i>defect</i> or <i>negation</i>
of <i>Knowledge</i>; for if I should always
<i>Clearly see</i> what were <i>True</i> and <i>Good</i>
I should never <i>deliberate</i> in my <i>Judgement</i>
or <i>Choice</i>, and Consequently, tho I were
<i>perfectly Free</i>, yet I should never be <i>Indifferent</i>.</p>

<p>From all which, I perceive that neither
the <i>Power</i> of <i>Willing precisely</i> so taken,
which I have from <i>God</i>, is the <i>Cause</i> of
my <i>Errors</i>, it being most <i>full</i> and <i>perfect</i> in
its kind; Neither also the <i>Power</i> of <i>Understanding</i>,
for whatever I <i>Understand</i>
(since ’tis from God that I <i>Understand</i> it) I
<i>understand aright</i>, nor can I be therein <i>Deceived</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>From <i>Whence</i> therefore proceed all my
<i>Errors</i>? To which, I answer, that they
proceed from <i>hence</i> only, that seeing the
<i>Will</i> expatiates it self <i>farther</i> then the <i>Understanding</i>,
I keep it not within the <i>same
bounds</i> with my <i>Understanding</i>, but often
extend it to those things which I <i>Understand
not</i>, to which things it being <i>Indifferent</i>,
it easily Declines from what is <i>True</i>
and <i>Good</i>; and consequently I am <i>Deceived</i>
and <i>Commit sin</i>. <a href="#note11" id="anchor8">*</a> Thus, for example,
when lately I felt my self to enquire,
Whether any thing doth <i>Exist</i>, and found
that from my setting <i>my self</i> to Examine
such a thing, it evidently follows that I <i>my
self Exist</i>, I could not but <i>Judge</i>, what I
so <i>clearly Understood</i>, to be <i>true</i>, not that I
was <i>forced</i> thereto by any <i>outward impulse</i>,
but because a <i>strong Propension</i> in my <i>Will</i>
did follow this <i>Great Light</i> in my <i>Understanding</i>,
so that I believed it so much the
more <i>freely</i> and <i>willingly</i>, by how much
the less <i>indifferent</i> I was thereto. But
now I understand, not only, that I <i>Exist</i>
as I am a <i>Thing</i> that <i>Thinks</i>, but I also meet
with a certain <i>Idea</i> of a <i>Corporeal Nature</i>,
and it so happens that I <i>doubt</i>, whether
that <i>Thinking Nature</i> that is in me be <i>Different</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
from that <i>Corporeal Nature</i>, or Whether
they are <i>both the same</i>: but in this <i>I</i>
suppose that <i>I</i> have found no Argument
to <i>incline</i> me <i>either ways</i>, and therefore <i>I</i>
am <i>Indifferent</i> to <i>affirm</i> or <i>deny either</i>, or to
<i>Judge nothing</i> of <i>either</i>; But this <i>indifferency</i>
extends it self not only to those things of
which I am <i>clearly ignorant</i>, but generally to
all those things which are <i>not</i> so very <i>evidently
known</i> to me at the Time when my
<i>Will Deliberates</i> of them; for tho never so
probable <i>Guesses incline</i> me to <i>one</i> side,
yet the Knowing that they are only <i>Conjectures</i>,
and not indubitable <i>reasons</i>, is enough
to Draw my <i>Assent</i> to the <i>Contrary</i>
Part. Which Lately <i>I</i> have sufficiently
experienced, when <i>I</i> supposed all those
things (which formerly <i>I</i> assented to as
most <i>True</i>) as very <i>False</i>, for this <i>Reason</i> only
that <i>I</i> found my self <i>able</i> to doubt of
them in some manner.</p>

<p>If I abstain from <i>passing</i> my <i>Judgment</i>,
when I do <i>not clearly</i> and <i>distinctly</i> enough
perceive what is <i>Truth</i>, ’tis evident that I
do <i>well</i>, and that I am <i>not deceived</i>: But if
I <i>affirm</i> or <i>deny</i>, then ’tis that I <i>abuse</i> the
<i>freedome</i> of my <i>will</i>, and if I turn my self
to that part which is <i>false</i>, I am <i>deceived</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
but if I <i>embrace</i> the <i>contrary</i> Part, ’tis but <i>by
chance</i> that I light on the <i>Truth</i>, yet I shall
not therefore be Blameless, for ’tis Manifest
by the <i>light</i> of <i>Nature</i> that the <i>Perception</i>
of the <i>Understanding ought</i> to preceed
the <i>Determination</i> of the <i>Will</i>. And ’tis
in this <i>abuse</i> of <i>Free-Will</i> that That <i>Privation</i>
consists, which Constitutes <i>Error</i>; I
say there is a <i>Privation</i> in the <i>Action</i> as it
proceeds from Me, but not in the <i>Faculty</i>
which I have received from <i>God</i>; nor in
the <i>Action</i> as it <i>depends</i> on <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>Neither have I any Reason to Complain
that God has not given me a <i>larger
Intellective Faculty</i>, or more <i>Natural Light</i>,
for ’tis a necessary Incident to a <i>finite Understanding</i>
that it should not Understand
<i>All</i> things, and ’tis Incident to a <i>Created
Understanding</i> to be <i>Finite</i>: and I have
more Reason to thank him for what he
has <i>bestowed</i> upon me (tho he <i>owed</i> me nothing)
then to think my self <i>Robbed</i> by
him of those things which he <i>never gave me</i>.</p>

<p>Nor have I Reason to Complain that he
has given me a <i>Will</i> larger then my <i>Understanding</i>:
for seeing the <i>Will</i> Consists
in <i>one</i> thing only, and as it were in an <i>Indivisible</i>
(viz. to <i>Will</i>, or <i>not to Will</i>) it seems<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
contrary to its nature that it should be
<i>less</i> then ’tis; and certainly by how much
the <i>Greater</i> it is, so much the more <i>Thankful</i>
I ought to be to <i>him</i>; that Gave it
me.</p>

<p>Neither can I Complain that God <i>concurrs</i>
with me in the Production of those
<i>Voluntary Actions</i> or <i>Judgements</i> in which
I am <i>deceived</i>: for those <i>Acts</i> as they <i>depend</i>
on <i>God</i> are altogether <i>True</i> and <i>Good</i>;
and I am in some measure <i>more perfect</i> in
that I can <i>so Act</i>, then if I could <i>not</i>: for
that <i>Privation</i>, in which the <i>Ratio Formalis</i>
of <i>Falshood</i> and <i>Sin</i> consists, wants not the
<i>Concourse</i> of <i>God</i>; For it is <i>not A Thing</i>,
and having respect to him as its <i>Cause</i>,
ought not to be called <i>Privation</i>, but <i>Negation</i>;
for certainly ’tis no <i>Imperfection</i> in
<i>God</i>, that he has given me a <i>freedome</i> of
<i>Assenting</i> or <i>not Assenting</i> to some things,
the <i>clear</i> and <i>distinct</i> Knowledge whereof
he has not <i>Imparted</i> to my <i>Understanding</i>;
but certainly ’tis an <i>Imperfection</i> in me,
that I <i>abuse</i> this <i>liberty</i>, and <i>pass</i> my <i>Judgement</i>
on those things which I do <i>not Rightly</i>
Understand.</p>

<p>Yet I see that ’tis Possible with <i>God</i> to
effect that (tho I should remain <i>Free</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
of a <i>Finite Knowledge</i>) I should <i>never Err</i>,
that is, if he had endowed my <i>Understanding</i>
with a <i>clear</i> and <i>distinct</i> Knowledge
of all things whereof I should ever
have an <i>Occasion</i> of <i>deliberating</i>; or if he
had only so firmly fix’d in my Mind, that
I should never forget, this, <i>That I must never
Judge of a thing which I do not clearly
and distinctly Understand</i>; Either of
which things had <i>God</i> done, I easily perceive
that <i>I</i> (as consider’d in my self)
should be <i>more perfect</i> then now I am, yet
nevertheless I cannot deny but that there
<i>may be a greater perfection</i> in the <i>whole Universe</i>
of Things, for that some of its parts
are Obnoxious to <i>Errors</i>, and some not, then
if they were all <i>alike</i>. And I have no
Reason to Complain, that it has pleased
God, that I should <i>Act</i> on the <i>Stage</i> of this
<i>World</i> a <i>Part</i> not the <i>chief</i> and <i>most perfect</i>
of all; Or that I should not be able to abstain
from <i>Error</i> in the <i>first way</i> above specifi’d,
which depends upon the <i>Evident
Knowledge</i> of those things whereof <i>I deliberate</i>;
Yet that I may abstain from <i>Error</i>
by the <i>other means</i> abovemention’d, which
depends only on this, <i>That I Judge not of
any Thing, the truth whereof is not Evident.</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
For tho I have experienced in my self this
<i>Infirmity</i>, that I cannot <i>always</i> be intent
upon <i>one</i> and the <i>same</i> Knowledge, yet <i>I</i>
may by a <i>continued</i> and <i>often repeated</i> Meditation
bring this to pass, that as often as
<i>I</i> have use of this Rule <i>I</i> may Remember
it, by which means I may Get (as it were)
an <i>habit</i> of <i>not erring</i>.</p>

<p>In which thing seeing, the <i>greatest</i> and
<i>chief perfection</i> of <i>Man</i> consists, <i>I</i> repute
my self to have gain’d much by this days
<i>Meditation</i>, for that therein <i>I</i> have discover’d
the <i>Cause</i> of <i>Error</i>, <i>and Falshood</i>;
which certainly can be no other then what
<i>I</i> have now Declared; for whenever in
Passing my Judgement, <i>I</i> bridle my <i>Will</i>
so that it extend it self <i>only</i> to those things
which I <i>clearly</i> and <i>distinctly</i> perceive, it
is impossible that I can <i>Err</i>. For doubtless
All <i>clear</i> and <i>distinct</i> Perception is <i>something</i>,
and therefore cannot <i>proceed</i> from
<i>Nothing</i>, but must necessarily have <i>God</i> for
its <i>Author</i> (<i>God</i>, I say, Who is <i>infinitely Perfect</i>,
and who <i>cannot Deceive</i>) and therefore
it Must be <i>True</i>.</p>

<p>Nor have I this Day learnt only what I
must <i>beware off</i> that I be not <i>deceived</i>, but
also what I must <i>Do</i> to Discover <i>Truth</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
for <i>That</i> I shall certainly find, if I fully
Apply my self to those things <i>only</i>, which
I <i>perfectly</i> understand; and if I distinguish
between those and what I apprehend but
<i>confusedly</i> and <i>obscurely</i>; Both which hereafter
I shall endeavour.</p>

And herein Again of <span class="antiqua">God</span>. And
that he does <span class="antiqua">Exist</span>.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>There are yet remaining many
Things concerning <i>Gods Attributes</i>,
and many things concerning the <i>nature</i>
of <i>my self</i> or of my <i>Mind</i>, which
ought to be searched into: but these perhaps
I shall set upon at some other Opportunity.
And at Present nothing seems
to me more requisite (feeling I have discover’d
what I must <i>avoid</i>, and what I must
<i>Do</i> for the <i>Attaining</i> of <i>Truth</i>) then that
I imploy my Endeavours to free my self
from those doubts into which I have lately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
fallen, and that I try whether I can have
any certainty of Material Things.</p>

<p>But before I enquire whether there be
any such things <i>Really Existent without</i> Me,
I ought to consider the <i>Ideas</i> of those things,
as they are in my Thoughts and try which
of them are <i>Distinct</i>, which <i>confused</i>.</p>

<p>In which search I find that I <i>distinctly
imagine Quantity</i>, that which Philosophers
commonly call <i>continued</i>, that is to say,
the <i>Extension</i> of that <i>Quantity</i> or thing
<i>continued</i> into <i>Length</i>, <i>Breadth</i>, and <i>Thickness</i>,
I can <i>count</i> in it divers Parts, to which
parts I can assign <i>Bigness</i>, <i>Figure</i>, <i>Position</i>,
and <i>Local Motion</i>, to which <i>Local Motion</i>
I can assign <i>Duration</i>. Neither are only
these <i>Generals</i> plainly discover’d and
known by Me, but also by attentive
Consideration, I perceive Innumerable
<i>particulars</i> concerning the <i>Shapes</i>, <i>Number</i>,
and <i>Motion</i> of These Bodies; The
<i>Truth</i> whereof is so <i>evident</i>, and <i>agreeable</i>
to my <i>Nature</i>, that when I first discover’d
them, I seemed not so much to have
<i>Learnt</i> any thing that is <i>new</i>, as to have
only <i>remembred</i> what I have known <i>before</i>,
or only to have thought on those
things which were in me <i>before</i>, tho this be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
the first time that I have examin’d them
so <i>diligently</i>.</p>

<p>One thing there is worthy my Consideration,
which is, that I find in my self innumerable
<i>Ideas</i> of certain things, which
tho perhaps they <i>exist no where without</i> Me,
yet they cannot Be said to be <i>Nothing</i>;
and tho they are <i>Thought</i> upon by me at
my <i>will</i> and <i>pleasure</i>, yet they are not <i>made</i>
by <i>Me</i>, but have their own <i>True</i> and <i>Immutable
Natures</i>. As when, for example,
<a href="#note12" id="anchor9">*</a> I <i>Imagine</i> a <i>Triangle</i>, tho perhaps such a
<i>Figure Exists no where</i> out of my <i>Thoughts</i>,
nor ever <i>will Exist</i>, yet the <i>Nature</i> thereof
is <i>determinate</i>, and its <i>Essence</i> or Form is
<i>Immutable</i> and <i>Eternal</i>, which is neither
<i>made</i> by me, nor <i>depends</i> on my mind, as
appears for that many <i>properties</i> may be
<i>demonstrated</i> of this Triangle, <i>viz.</i> That
its three Angles are equal to two
right ones, that to its Greatest Angle the
Greatest side is subtended, and such
like, which I now <i>clearly</i> know whether
<i>I will or not</i>, tho before <i>I</i> never thought
on them, when I <i>imagine</i> a Triangle, and
consequently they could not be invented
by Me. And ’tis nothing to the purpose
for me to say, that perhaps this <i>Idea</i> of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
Triangle came to me by the Organs of
<i>sense</i>, because I have sometimes seen bodies
of a <i>Triangular Shape</i>; for I can think
of Innumerable other <i>Figures</i>, which I
cannot suspect to have come in through my
<i>senses</i>, and yet I can <i>Demonstrate</i> various
<i>properties</i> of them, as well as of a <i>Triangle</i>,
which certainly are all <i>true</i>, seeing I
know them <i>clearly</i>, and therefore they are
<i>something</i>, and not a meer <i>Nothing</i>, for ’tis
Evident that <i>what is true is something</i>.</p>

<p>And now I have sufficiently Demonstrated,
that <i>what I clearly perceive, is True</i>;
And tho I had <i>not demonstrated</i> it, yet such
is the <i>Nature</i> of my <i>Mind</i>, that I could
not but give my <i>Assent</i> to what I <i>so</i> perceive,
at least, as long as I <i>so</i> perceive it;
and I remember (heretofore when I most
of all relied on <i>sensible Objects</i>) that I held
those <i>Truths</i> for the most <i>certain</i> which I <i>evidently</i>
perceived, such as are concerning
<i>Figures</i>, <i>Numbers</i>, with other parts of <i>Arithmetick</i>,
and <i>Geometry</i>, as also whatever
relates to <i>pure</i> and <i>abstracted Mathematicks</i>.</p>

<p>Now therefore, if from this alone, <i>That
I can frame the Idea of a Thing in my Mind</i>,
it follows, <i>That whatever I clearly and distinctly
perceive belonging to a thing</i>, does<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
<i>Really belong to it</i>; Cannot I from hence
draw an Argument to Prove the <i>Existence</i>
of a <i>God</i>? Certainly I find the <i>Idea</i> of a
<i>God</i>, or <i>infinitely perfect Being</i>, as <i>naturally</i> in
me, as the <i>Idea</i> of any <i>Figure</i>, or <i>Number</i>;
and I as <i>clearly</i> and <i>distinctly</i> understand that
it appertains to his <i>Nature Always to Be</i>, as I
know that what I can <i>demonstrate</i> of a <i>Mathematical
Figure</i> or <i>Number</i> belongs to the <i>Nature</i>
of that <i>Figure</i> or <i>Number</i>: so that, tho all
things which I have <i>Meditated</i> upon these
three or four days were not <i>true</i>, yet I may
well be as <i>certain</i> of the <i>Existence</i> of a <i>God</i>, as
I have hitherto been of <i>Mathematical Truths</i>.</p>

<p><i>Doubt.</i> Yet this Argument at first sight
appears not so <i>evident</i>, but looks rather
like a <i>sophism</i>; for seeing I am used in all
other things to <i>Distinguish Existence</i> from
<i>Essence</i>, I can easily perswade my self that
the <i>Existence</i> of <i>God</i> may be <i>distinguish’d</i>
from his <i>Essence</i>, so that I may <i>Imagine God</i>
not to <i>Exist</i>.</p>

<p><i>Solution.</i> But considering it more strictly,
’tis manifest, that the <i>Existence</i> of <i>God</i>
can no more be <i>seperated</i> from his <i>Essence</i>,
then the <i>Equality</i> of the <i>Three Angles</i> to <i>two
right ones</i> can be <i>seperated</i> from the <i>Essence</i>
of a <i>Triangle</i>, or then the <i>Idea</i> of a <i>Mountain</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
can be <i>without</i> the <i>Idea</i> of a <i>valley</i>; so
that ’tis no less a <i>Repugnancy</i> to think of
a <i>God</i> (that is, <i>A Being infinitely perfect</i>)
who wants <i>Existence</i> (that is, who wants a
<i>Perfection</i>) then to think of a <i>Mountain</i>,
to which there is <i>no Valley adjoyning</i>.</p>

<p><i>Doubt.</i> But what if I cannot imagine
<i>God</i> but as <i>Existing</i>, or a <i>Mountain without
a Vally</i>? yet supposing me to think of
a <i>Mountain with a Vally</i>, it does not from
thence follow, that there <i>Is a Mountain</i> in
the World; so supposing me to think of
a <i>God</i> as <i>Existing</i>, yet does it not follow
that <i>God Really Exists</i>. For my <i>Thought
imposes</i> no <i>necessity</i> on Things, and as I may
imagine a <i>Winged Horse</i>, tho no <i>Horse</i> has
<i>Wings</i>, so I may imagine an <i>existing God</i>,
tho no <i>God exist</i>.</p>

<p><i>Solution.</i> ’Tis true the <i>Sophism</i> seems to
lie in this, yet tho I cannot conceive a
<i>Mountain</i> but with a <i>Vally</i>, it does not
from hence follow, that a <i>Mountain</i> or
<i>Vally</i> do <i>Exist</i>, but this will follow, that
whether a <i>Mountain</i> or a <i>Vally do</i> or <i>do not
Exist</i>, yet they cannot be <i>seperated</i>: so from
hence that I cannot think of <i>God</i> but as
<i>Existing</i>, it follows that <i>Existence</i> is <i>Inseperable</i>
from <i>God</i>, and therefore that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
<i>Really Exists</i>; Not because my <i>Thought</i>
does all this, or <i>Imposes</i> any <i>necessity</i> on any
Thing, but contrarily, because the <i>necessity</i>
of the thing it self (<i>viz.</i> of <i>Gods Existence</i>)
<i>Determines</i> me to <i>think</i> thus; for
’tis not in my Power to think a <i>God</i> without
<i>Existence</i> (that is, <i>A Being absolutely
perfect</i> without the <i>Cheif Perfection</i>) as it is
in my Power to imagine a Horse either
<i>with</i> or <i>without Wings</i>.</p>

<p><i>Doubt.</i> And here it cannot be said, that
I am forced to suppose <i>God Existing</i>, after I
have supposed him <i>endowed</i> with all <i>Perfections</i>,
seeing <i>Existence</i> is one of them;
but that my <i>First Position</i> (<i>viz.</i> His <i>Absolute
Perfection</i>) is not <i>necessary</i>. Thus, for
example, ’tis not <i>necessary</i> for me to think
all <i>Quadrilateral Figures</i> inscribed in a <i>Circle</i>;
But supposing that I think <i>so</i>, I am then
<i>necessitated</i> to Confess a <i>Rhombe Inscribed</i>
therein, and yet this is evidently <i>False</i>.</p>

<p><i>Solution.</i> For tho I am not forced at any
time to think of a <i>God</i>; yet as often as I
cast my Thoughts on a <i>First</i> and <i>Cheif Being</i>,
and as it were bring forth out of the
Treasury of my Mind an <i>Idea</i> thereof, I
must of necessity attribute thereto all
Manner of <i>Perfections</i>, tho I do not at that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
time <i>count</i> them over, or <i>Remark</i> each single
One; which <i>necessity</i> is sufficient to
make me hereafter (when I come to consider
<i>Existence</i> to be a <i>Perfection</i>) conclude
<i>Rightly, That the First and Chief Being does
Exist</i>. Thus, for example, I am not obliged
at any time to imagine a <i>Triangle</i>,
yet whenever I please to Consider of a
<i>Right-lined Figure</i> having only <i>three Angles</i>,
I am then <i>necessitated</i> to allow it all
those <i>Requisites</i> from which I may argue
rightly, <i>That the Three Angles thereof are
not Greater then Two Right Ones</i>, Tho upon
the first consideration this came not
into my Thought. But when I enquire
what Figures may be <i>inscribed</i> within a
<i>Circle</i>, I am not at all <i>necessitated</i> to think
that all <i>Quadrilateral Figures</i> are of that
sort; neither can I possibly imagine this,
whilst I admit of nothing, but what I <i>clearly</i>
and <i>distinctly</i> Understand: and therefore
there is a great Difference between
these <i>False suppositions</i>, and <i>True natural Ideas</i>,
the <i>first</i> and <i>Chief</i>; whereof is that of
a <i>God</i>; For by many wayes I understand
<i>That</i> not to be a <i>Fiction depending</i> on my
<i>Thought</i>, but an <i>Image</i> of a <i>True</i> and <i>Immutable
Nature</i>; As first, because I can think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
of no other thing but <i>God</i> to Whose <i>Essence
Existence</i> belongs. Next because I
cannot Imagine <i>Two</i> or <i>More Gods</i>, and
supposing that he is <i>now</i> only One, I may
plainly perceive it <i>necessary</i> for <i>Him</i> to
<i>Have been from Eternity</i>, and <i>will Be to Eternity</i>;
And Lastly because I perceive
many Other Things in <i>God</i>, Which I cannot
<i>Change</i>, and from which I cannot <i>Detract</i>.</p>

<p>But whatever way of Argumentation
I use, it comes All at last to this one Thing,
That I am fully perswaded of the <i>Truth</i> of
those things only, which appear to me
<i>clearly</i> and <i>distinctly</i>. And tho some of
those things, which I so perceive, are obvious
to <i>every</i> Man, and some are only discover’d
by Those that search more <i>nighly</i>,
and enquire more <i>carefully</i>, yet when such
<i>truths</i> are discover’d, they are esteem’d no
less <i>certain</i> than the Others. For Example,
Tho it do not so easily appear, that
in a Rightangled Triangle, the square of
the Base is equal to the squares of the sides,
as it appears, that the Base is suspended under
its Largest Angle, yet the <i>first Proposition</i>
is <i>no less certainly</i> believed when once
’tis perceived, then this <i>Last</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>Thus in Reference to <i>God</i>; certainly,
unless I am overrun with <i>Prejudice</i>, or
have my thoughts begirt on all sides with
<i>sensible Objects</i>, I should acknowledge nothing
<i>before</i> or <i>easier</i> then him; For what
is more <i>self-evident</i> then that there is a
<i>Chief Being</i>, or then that a <i>God</i> (to whose
<i>essence alone Existence</i> appertains) does
<i>Exist</i>? And tho serious Consideration is
required to perceive thus much, yet <i>Now</i>,
I am not only equally <i>certain</i> of it, as of
what seems most <i>certain</i>, but I perceive also
that the <i>Truth</i> of other Things so <i>depends</i>
on it, that without it nothing can ever
be <i>perfectly known</i>.</p>

<p>For tho my <i>nature</i> be <i>such</i>, that during
the time of my <i>Clear</i> and <i>Distinct</i> Perception,
I cannot but believe it <i>true</i>; yet
my <i>Nature</i> is <i>such</i> also, that I cannot fix the
<i>Intention</i> of my <i>Mind</i> upon one and the
same thing alwayes, so as to perceive it
<i>clearly</i>, and the Remembrance of what
<i>Judgement</i> I have formerly made is often
stirred up, when I cease attending to those
reasons for which I passed such a Judgment,
other Reasons may then be produced,
which (if I did not <i>know God</i>) may
easily <i>move</i> me in my <i>Opinion</i>; and by this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
means I shall never attain to the <i>true</i> and
<i>certain Knowledge</i> of any Thing, but <i>Wandring</i>
and <i>Unstable opinions</i>. So, for example,
when I consider the Nature of a
Triangle, it plainly appears to me (as understanding
the Principles of Geometry)
that its three Angles are equal to two right
ones; And this I must of necessity think
<i>True</i> as long as I attend to the <i>Demonstration</i>
thereof; but as soon as ever I withdraw
my Mind from the <i>Consideration</i> of
its <i>Proof</i> (altho I remember that I have
once <i>Clearly</i> perceived it) yet perhaps I
may <i>doubt</i> of Its <i>Truth</i>, being as yet <i>Ignorant</i>
of a <i>God</i>; For I may perswade my
self, that I am so framed by <i>Nature</i>, as to
be <i>deceived</i> in those things which I imagine
my self to perceive most <i>evidently</i>,
Especially when I recollect, that heretofore
I have often accounted many things
<i>True</i> and <i>Certain</i>, which afterward upon
other Reasons I have Judged as False. But
when I perceive that there is a <i>God</i>; because
at the same time I also Understand
that all things <i>Depend</i> on Him, and that he
is not a <i>Deceiver</i>; and when from hence I
Collect that all those Things which I <i>clearly</i>
and <i>distinctly</i> perceive are <i>necessarily True</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
tho I have no further Respects to those
Reasons which induced me to believe it
<i>True</i>, yet if I do but remember, that I
have <i>once clearly</i> and <i>distinctly</i> perceived it,
no Argument can be brought on the contrary,
that shall make me <i>doubt</i>, but that I
have <i>true</i> and <i>certain</i> Knowledge thereof;
and not onely of that, but of all other
<i>Truths</i> also which I remember that I have
<i>once Demonstrated</i>, such as are <i>Geometrical
Propositions</i> and the like.</p>

<p>What now can be <i>Objected</i> against me?
shall I say, that I am so made by <i>Nature</i>, as
to be often <i>deceived</i>? No; For I now
Know that I cannot be <i>deceived</i> in those
Things, which I <i>clearly</i> Understand. Shall
I say, that at other times I have esteem’d
many Things <i>True</i> and <i>Certain</i>, which afterwards
I found to be <i>falsities</i>? No; for
I perceived none of those things <i>clearly</i> and
<i>distinctly</i>, but being Ignorant of this <i>Rule</i>
of <i>Truth</i>, I took them up for Reasons, which
Reasons I afterward found to be <i>Weak</i>.
What then can be said? Shall, I say, (as lately
I objected) that Perhaps I am <i>asleep</i>, and that
what I now think of is no more <i>True</i>, then
the <i>Dreams</i> of People <i>asleep</i>? But this it self
<i>moves</i> not my Opinion; for certainly tho<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
I were <i>asleep</i>, if any thing appear’d <i>evident</i>
to my Understanding, ’twould be
<i>True</i>.</p>

<p>And Thus I Plainly see, that the <i>Certainty</i>
and <i>Truth</i> of all <i>Science</i> Depends
on the <i>Knowledge</i> of the <i>True
God</i>, so that before I had <i>Known Him</i>,
I did <i>Know nothing</i>; But now many
things both of <i>God</i> himself, and of other
<i>Intellectual Things</i>, as also of <i>Corporeal
nature</i>, which is the <i>Object</i> of <i>Mathematicks</i>,
may be <i>Plainly Known</i> and <i>Certain</i>
to me.</p>

<span class="antiqua">Existence</span>: As Also of the Real
Difference, Between <span class="antiqua">Mind</span> and
<span class="antiqua">Body</span>.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>It now remains that I examine whether
any <i>Corporeal Beings</i> do <i>Exist</i>;
And already I know that (as they are the
<i>Object</i> of <i>Pure Mathematicks</i>) they <i>May</i>
(at least) <i>Exist</i>, for I <i>clearly</i> and <i>distinctly</i>
perceive them; and doubtless <i>God</i> is <i>able</i>
to <i>make</i>, whatever I am <i>able</i> to <i>perceive</i>, and
I never Judged any thing to be <i>beyond</i> his
<i>Power</i>, but what was <i>Repugnant</i> to a <i>distinct
perception</i>. Moreover, such <i>Material Beings
seem</i> to <i>Exist</i> from the <i>faculty</i> of <i>Imagination</i>,
which I find my self make use
of, when I am conversant about them: for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
if I attentively Consider what <i>Imagination</i>
is, ’twill appear to be only <i>a certain Application
of our Cognoscitive or knowing Faculty
to a Body or Object that is before it</i>;
and if it be <i>before it</i>, It must <i>Exist</i>.</p>

<p>But that this may be made more <i>Plain</i>,
I must first examine the <i>difference</i> between
<i>Imagination</i>, and <i>pure Intellection</i>, or <i>Understanding</i>.
So, for example, when I <i>Imagine</i>
a Triangle, I do not only <i>Understand</i>
that it is a <i>figure comprehended</i> by
<i>three Lines</i>, but I also <i>behold</i> with the
<i>eye</i> of my <i>mind</i> those <i>three lines</i> as it were
<i>before Me</i>, and this is that which I call <i>imagination</i>.
But if I convert my Thoughts
to a <i>Chiliogone</i>, or <i>Figure consisting</i> of a
<i>Thousand Angles</i>, I know as well that this
Is a <i>figure comprehended</i> by a <i>Thousand sides</i>,
as I know that a <i>Triangle</i> is a <i>Figure Consisting</i>
of <i>three sides</i>; but I do not in the
same Manner <i>Imagine</i>, or <i>behold</i> as <i>present</i>
those <i>thousand sides</i>, as I do the <i>three sides</i>
of a <i>Triangle</i>. And tho at the time when
I so think of a <i>Chiliogone</i>, I may <i>confusedly</i>
represent to my self some <i>Figure</i> (because
whenever I Think of a <i>Corporeal Object</i>,
I am used to <i>Imagine</i> some <i>Shape</i> or other)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
yet ’tis evident that this <i>Representation</i> is
not a <i>Chiliogone</i>, because ’tis in nothing <i>different</i>
from what I should Represent to my
self if I thought of a <i>Milion-angled figure</i>,
or any other Figure of <i>More sides</i>; Neither
does such a <i>Confused Representation</i>
help me in the least to know those <i>Properties</i>,
by which a <i>Chiliogone</i> differs from other
<i>Polygones</i> or <i>Manyangled Figures</i>. But
if a Question be put concerning a <i>Pentagone</i>,
I know I may <i>Understand its Shape</i>,
as I <i>Understand</i> the <i>Shape</i>, of a <i>Chiliogone</i>,
without the help of <i>Imagination</i>, but I can
also <i>imagine</i> it, by applying the <i>Eye</i> of my
<i>Mind</i> to its <i>Five sides</i>, and to the <i>Area</i> or
<i>space</i> contained by Them; And herein I
manifestly perceive that there is required
a <i>peculiar sort</i> of <i>Operation</i> in the <i>Mind</i> to
<i>imagine</i> a Thing, which I require not to
<i>Understand</i> a Thing; which <i>New Operation</i>
of the <i>Mind</i> plainly shews the <i>difference</i>
between <i>imagination</i> and <i>pure Intellection</i>.</p>

<p>Besides this, I Consider that this <i>Power</i>
of <i>Imagination</i> which is in me (as it differs
from the <i>Power</i> of <i>Understanding</i>) does
not appertain to the <i>Essence</i> of <i>Me</i>, that
is, of <i>my mind</i>, for tho I <i>wanted</i> it, yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
certainly I should be the <i>same He, that</i> now
<i>I am</i>: from whence it seems to follow,
that it depends on something <i>different</i> from
<i>my self</i>; and I easily perceive that if any <i>Body</i>
whatever did <i>Exist</i>, to which my <i>Mind</i>
were so <i>conjoyn’d</i>, that it may Apply it self
when it pleased to <i>Consider</i>, or (as it were)
<i>Look</i> into <i>this Body</i>; From hence, I say,
I perceive <i>It may so be</i>, that by this very
<i>Body</i> I may <i>Imagine Corporeal Beings</i>: So
that this <i>Manner</i> of <i>Thinking</i> differs from
<i>pure Intellection</i> only in this, that the <i>Mind</i>,
when it <i>Understands</i>, does as it were turn
<i>it self</i>, to <i>it self</i>, or <i>Reflect</i> on it self, and
<i>beholds</i> some or other of those <i>Ideas</i> which
are in it self; But when it <i>Imagines</i>, it <i>Converts</i>
it self upon <i>Body</i>, and therein <i>beholds</i>
something Conformable to that <i>Idea</i>,
which it hath <i>understood</i>, or <i>perceived</i> by
<i>Sense</i>.</p>

<p>But ’tis to be remembred, that I said, I easily
conceive Imagination <i>May be</i> so performed,
supposing <i>Body</i> to <i>Exist</i>. And because
no so convenient manner of Explaining
it offers it self, from thence I <i>probably</i>
guess, that <i>Body</i> does <i>Exist</i>. But
this I only say <i>probably</i>, for tho I should accurately
search into all the Arguments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
drawn from the <i>distinct Idea</i> of <i>Body</i>,
which I find in my <i>Imagination</i>, yet I find
none of them, from whence I may <i>necessarily</i>
conclude, <i>that Body does Exist</i>.</p>

<p>But I have been accustomed to <i>Imagine</i>
many other things besides that <i>Corporeal Nature</i>
which is the <i>Object</i> of <i>pure Mathematicks</i>;
such as are, <i>Colours</i>, <i>Sounds</i>, <i>Tasts</i>,
<i>Pain</i>, &amp;c. but none of these so <i>distinctly</i>.
And because I perceive these better by
<i>Sense</i>, from Which by the Help of the <i>Memory</i>
they come to the <i>Imagination</i>, that I
may with the Greater advantage treat of
them, I ought at the same time to Consider
<i>Sence</i>, and to try whether from what I perceive
by that way of <i>Thought</i>, which I call
<i>Sense</i>, I can deduce any certain Argument
for the <i>Existence</i> of <i>Corporeal Beings</i>.</p>

<p>And first I will here reflect with my
self, what those things were, which being
perceived by <i>Sence</i> I have heretofore
thought <i>True</i>, and the <i>Reasons</i> why
I <i>so thought</i>: I will then enquire into
the <i>Reasons</i> for which I afterwards <i>doubted</i>
those things. And last of all I will
consider what I <i>ought</i> to <i>think</i> of those
Things at <i>Present</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Reasons why I Trusted my Senses.</i></div>

<p>First therefore I have always thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
that I have had an <i>Head</i>, <i>Hands</i>,
<i>Feet</i>, and other <i>Members</i>, of
which <i>This Body</i> (which I have
look’d upon as a <i>Part</i> of <i>Me</i>,
or Perhaps as my <i>Whole self</i>) Consists;
And I have also thought that this <i>Body</i> of
<i>Mine</i> is Conversant or engaged among
many <i>Other Bodies</i>, by which it is Liable to
be <i>affected</i> with what is <i>advantagious</i> or
<i>hurtful</i>; What was <i>Advantagious</i> I judged
by a certain <i>sense</i> of <i>Pleasure</i>, what was
<i>Hurtful</i> by a <i>sense</i> of <i>Pain</i>. Furthermore,
besides <i>Pleasure</i> and <i>Pain</i>, I perceived
in my self <i>Hunger</i>, <i>Thirst</i>, and other
such like <i>Appetites</i>, as also certain <i>Corporeal
Propensions</i> to <i>Mirth</i>, <i>Sadness</i>, <i>Anger</i>, and
other like <i>Passions</i>.</p>

<p>As to What hapned to me from <i>Bodies
without</i>, Besides the <i>Extension</i>, <i>Figure</i>, and
<i>Motion</i> of those <i>Bodies</i>, I also perceived in
them <i>Hardness</i>, <i>Heat</i>, and other <i>tactile
Qualities</i>, as also <i>Light</i>, <i>Colours</i>, <i>Smells</i>,
<i>Tasts</i>, <i>Sounds</i>, &amp;c. and by the <i>Variation</i> of
these I <i>distinguish’d</i> the <i>Heaven</i>, <i>Earth</i>,
and <i>Seas</i>, and all other <i>Bodies</i> from each
other.</p>

<p>Neither was it wholly without Reason
(upon the account of these <i>Ideas</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
<i>Qualities</i>, which offer’d themselves to my
Thoughts, and which alone I <i>properly</i> and
<i>Immediately perceived</i>) that I thought my
self to Perceive some Things <i>Different</i>
from my <i>Thought, viz.</i> The <i>Bodies</i> or <i>Objects</i>
from whence these <i>Ideas</i> might <i>Proceed</i>;
for I often found these <i>Ideas</i> come
upon me without my <i>Consent</i> or <i>Will</i>; so
that I can neither perceive an <i>Object</i> (<i>tho
I had a mind to it</i>) unless it were <i>before</i> the
Organs of my <i>Sense</i>; Neither can I <i>Hinder</i>
my self from perceiving it, when it is
<i>Present</i>.</p>

<p>And seeing that those <i>Ideas</i> which I take
in by sense are much more <i>Lively</i>, <i>Apparent</i>
and in their kind more <i>distinct</i>, than any of
those which <i>I knowingly</i> and <i>Willingly</i> frame
by Meditation, or stir up in my <i>Memory</i>; it
seems to me that they cannot proceed
from <i>my self</i>. There remains therefore
no other way for them to come upon me,
but from some other Things <i>Without</i> Me.
Of Which Things seeing <i>I</i> have no other
Knowledge but from these <i>Ideas</i>, <i>I</i> cannot
Think but that these <i>Ideas</i> are <i>like</i> the
Things.</p>

<p>Moreover, Because <i>I</i> remember that <i>I</i>
first made use of my <i>senses</i> before my <i>Reason</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
and because <i>I</i> did perceive that
those <i>Ideas</i> which <i>I</i> my self did frame
were not so <i>Manifest</i> as those which <i>I</i> received
by my <i>senses</i>, but very often <i>made
up of their parts</i>, <i>I</i> was easily perswaded
to think that <i>I</i> had no <i>Idea</i> in my <i>Understanding</i>,
which I had not <i>First</i> in my
<i>sense</i>.</p>

<p>Neither was it without Reason that <i>I</i>
Judged, <i>That Body</i> (which by a <i>peculiar
right I</i> call my <i>Own</i>) to be <i>more nighly</i> appertaining
to <i>Me</i> then any <i>other Body</i>.
For from It, as from other <i>Bodies</i>, <i>I</i> can never
be <i>seperated</i>, <i>I</i> was <i>sensible</i> of all <i>Appetites</i>
and <i>Affections in It</i> and <i>for It</i>, and
lastly <i>I</i> perceived <i>pleasure</i> and <i>Pain</i> in its
Parts, and not in any other Without it.
But why from the <i>sense</i> of Pain a certain
<i>Grief</i>, and from the <i>sense</i> of <i>pleasure</i> a certain
<i>Joy</i> of the <i>Mind</i> should arise, or Why
that <i>Gnawing</i> of the <i>stomach</i>, Which <i>I</i> call
<i>Hunger</i>, should put me in mind of <i>Eating</i>,
or the <i>driness</i> of my <i>Throat</i> of <i>Drinking</i>,
<i>I</i> can give no other Reason but <i>that I am
taught so by Nature</i>. For to my thinking
there is no <i>Affinity</i> or <i>Likeness</i> between
that <i>Gnawing</i> of the <i>Stomach</i>, and the desire
of <i>Eating</i>, or between the <i>sense</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
<i>Pain</i>, and the <i>sorrowful thought</i> from
thence arising. But in this as in all other
<i>judgments</i> that I made of <i>sensible objects</i>,
I seem’d to be taught by <i>Nature</i>, for I first
perswaded my self that things were <i>so</i>
or <i>so</i>, before ever I enquired into a
Reason that may prove it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Reasons why I doubted my senses.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Medit. I.</i></div>

<p>But afterwards I discover’d
many experiments,
wherein my <i>senses</i> so grosly
deceived me, that I would never trust
them again; for Towers which seem’d
<i>Round</i> a far off, nigh at hand appear’d
<i>square</i>, and <i>large</i> Statues on their tops seem’d
<i>small</i> to those that stood on the ground;
and in numberless other things, I perceived
the <i>judgements</i> of my <i>outward senses</i>
were <i>deceived</i>: and not of my <i>outward</i>
only, but of my <i>inward senses</i> also; for
what is more <i>intimate</i> or <i>inward</i> than
<i>Pain</i>? And yet I have heard from those,
whose Arm or Leg was cut off, that they
have felt <i>pain</i> in that part which they
<i>wanted</i>, and therefore I am not <i>absolutely
certain</i> that any part of me is affected
with <i>pain</i>, tho I <i>feel pain</i> therein. To
these I have lately added two
very <i>general Reasons</i> of <i>doubt</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
The first was, that while I was <i>awake</i>, I
could not believe my self to perceive any
thing, which I could not think my self
sometimes to perceive, tho I were <i>a sleep</i>;
And seeing I cannot believe, that what I
seem to perceive in my <i>sleep</i> proceeds
from <i>outward Objects</i>, what greater Reason
have I to think so of what I perceive
whilst I am <i>awake</i>? The other Cause of
Doubt was, that seeing I know not the
<i>Author</i> of my <i>Being</i> (or at least I then <i>supposed</i>
my self not to know him) what
reason is there but that I may be so ordered
by <i>Nature</i> as to be <i>deceived</i> even in
those things which appear’d to me most
<i>true</i>. And as to the <i>Reasons</i>, which induced
me to give <i>credit</i> to <i>sensible</i> Things,
’twas easie to return an answer thereto, for
finding by experience, that I was impelled
by <i>Nature</i> to many Things, which
<i>Reason</i> disswaded me from, I thought I
should not far trust what I was taught by
<i>Nature</i>. And tho the perceptions of my
<i>senses</i> depended not on my <i>Will</i>, I thought
<i>I</i> should not therefore conclude, that
they proceeded from <i>Objects different</i> from
my self; for perhaps there may be some
other <i>Faculty</i> in me (tho as yet <i>unknown</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
to me) which might frame those <i>perceptions</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>How far the senses are now to be trusted.</i></div>

<p>But now that I begin better
to know <i>my self</i> and the
Author of my <i>Original</i>, I
do not think, that all things, which I
seem to have from my <i>senses</i> are <i>rashly</i> to
be <i>admitted</i>, neither are all things so <i>had</i>,
to be <i>doubted</i>. And first because I know
that whatever I <i>clearly</i> and <i>distinctly</i> perceive,
<i>may be</i> so made by <i>God</i> as I perceive
them; the <i>Power</i> of <i>understanding
clearly</i> and <i>distinctly</i> one Thing <i>without</i> the
other is sufficient to make Me <i>certain</i> that
One Thing is <i>different</i> from the Other;
because it <i>may</i> at least be placed apart by
<i>God</i>, and that it may be esteem’d <i>different</i>,
it matters not by what <i>Power</i> it <i>may</i>
be so <i>sever’d</i>. And therefore from the
knowledge I have, that <i>I my self exist</i>,
and because at the same time I understand
that nothing else appertains to my <i>Nature</i>
or <i>Essence</i>, but that I am a <i>thinking Being</i>,
I rightly conclude, that my <i>Essence</i> consists
in this alone, that I am a <i>thinking Thing</i>.
And tho <i>perhaps</i> (or, as I shall shew presently,
’tis <i>certain</i>) I have a <i>Body</i> which
is very <i>nighly</i> conjoyned to me, yet because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
on this side I have a clear and <i>distinct
Idea</i> of my self, as I am only a <i>thinking Thing,
not extended</i>; and on the other side because
I have a <i>distinct Idea</i> of my <i>Body</i>, as
it is onely an <i>extended</i> thing, <i>not thinking</i>,
’tis from hence <i>certain</i>, that I <i>am really
distinct from my Body</i>, and that I can <i>exist
without</i> it.</p>

<p>Moreover I find in my self some <i>Faculties</i>
endow’d with <i>certain</i> peculiar waies
of <i>thinking</i>, such as the <i>Faculty</i> of <i>Imagination</i>,
the <i>Faculty</i> of <i>Perception</i> or <i>sense</i>;
without which <i>I</i> can conceive my <i>whole
self clearly</i> and <i>distinctly</i>, but (changing
the phrase) <i>I</i> cannot <i>conceive</i> those <i>Faculties</i>
without <i>conceiving My self</i>, that is, an
<i>understanding substance</i> in which they are;
for none of them in their <i>formal Conception</i>
includes <i>understanding</i>; from whence
I perceive they are as <i>different</i> from <i>me</i>,
as the <i>modus</i> or <i>manner</i> of a Thing is <i>different</i>
from the <i>Thing it self</i>.</p>

<p>I acknowledge also, that I have several
other <i>Faculties</i>, such as <i>changing</i> of
<i>place</i>, <i>putting on various shapes</i>, &amp;c. Which
can no more be understood without a
<i>substance</i> in which they are, then the foremention’d
<i>Faculties</i>, and consequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
they can no more be understood to <i>Exist</i>
without that <i>substance</i>: But yet ’tis Manifest,
that this sort of <i>Faculties</i>, to the
End they may exist, ought to be in a <i>Corporeal</i>,
<i>Extended</i>, and not in an <i>Understanding
substance</i>, because <i>Extension</i>, and not
<i>Intellection</i> or <i>Understanding</i> is included
in the <i>Clear</i> and <i>Distinct conception</i> of
them.</p>

<p>But there is also in me a certain <i>Passive
Faculty</i> of <i>sense</i>, or of <i>Receiving</i> and
<i>Knowing</i> the <i>Ideas</i> of <i>sensible Things</i>; of
which <i>Faculty</i> I can make no use, unless
there were in my self, or in something
else, a certain <i>Active Faculty</i> of <i>Producing</i>
and <i>Effecting</i> those <i>Ideas</i>. But this cannot
be in my self, for it Pre-supposes no
<i>Understanding</i>, and those <i>Ideas</i> are Produced
in me, tho I help not, and often against
my <i>Will</i>. There remains therefore
no Place for this <i>Active Faculty</i>, but that
it should be in some <i>substance different</i> from
me. In which because all the <i>Reallity</i>,
which is contain’d <i>Objectively</i> in the <i>Ideas</i>
Produced by that <i>Faculty</i>, ought to be
contain’d <i>Formally</i> or <i>Eminently</i> (as I have
Formerly taken notice) this <i>substance</i> must
be either <i>a Body</i> (in which what is in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
<i>Ideas Objectively</i> is contain’d <i>Formally</i>) or
it Must Be <i>God</i>, or some <i>Creature</i> more <i>excellent</i>
then a <i>Body</i> (In which what is in
the <i>Ideas Objectively</i> is contain’d <i>Eminently</i>).
But seeing that <i>God</i> is not a <i>Deceivour</i>,
’tis altogether Manifest, that <i>he</i> does not
Place these <i>Ideas</i> in me either <i>Immediately</i>
from himself, or <i>Mediately</i> from any other
Creature, wherein their <i>Objective Reallity</i>
is not <a href="#note13" id="anchor10">*</a> contain’d <i>Formally</i>, but only <i>Eminently</i>.
And seeing <i>God</i> has given me
no <i>Faculty</i> to discern Whether these Ideas
proceed from <i>Corporeal</i> or <i>Incorporeal
Beings</i>, but rather a <i>strong Inclination</i> to
believe that they are sent from <i>Corporeal
Beings</i>, there is no Reason Why God
should not be counted a <i>Deceiver</i>, if these
<i>Ideas</i> came from any Where, but from <i>Corporeal
Things</i>. Therefore we must conclude
that there are <i>Corporeal Beings</i>. Which perhaps
are not all the same as I comprehend
them by <i>my sense</i> (for Perception by sense is
in many Things very <i>Obscure</i> and <i>Confused</i>)
but those things at least, which I <i>clearly</i> and
<i>distinctly</i> Understand, that is to say, all
those things which are comprehended
under the <i>Object</i> of <i>Pure Mathematicks</i>;
those things I say at least are <i>True</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>As to What Remains, They are either
some <i>Particulars</i>, as that the Sun is of such
a <i>Bigness</i> or <i>Shape</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> or they are Things
less <i>Clearly</i> Understood, as <i>Light</i>, <i>Sound</i>,
<i>Pain</i>, &amp;c. And tho these and such like Things
may be very <i>Doubtful</i> and <i>Uncertain</i>, yet
because <i>God</i> is not a <i>Deceiver</i>, and because
that (Therefore) none of my Opinions
can be <i>false</i> unless God has Given me some
<i>Faculty</i> or other to <i>Correct</i> my <i>Error</i>, hence
’tis that I am incouraged with the Hopes of
attaining <i>Truth</i> even in these very Things.</p>

<p>And certainly it cannot be doubted but
whatever <i>I</i> am taught by <i>Nature</i> has something
therein of <i>Truth</i>. By <i>Nature</i> in General
I understand either <i>God</i> himself, or the
<i>Coordination</i> of Creatures Made by God.
By my <i>Own Nature</i> in <i>Particular</i> I understand
the <i>Complexion</i> or <i>Association</i> of all
those things which are given me by God.</p>

<p>Now there is nothing that this <i>my Nature</i>
teaches me more <i>expresly</i> then that I
have a <i>Body</i>, Which is not <i>Well</i> when I
<i>feel Pain</i>, that this <i>Body</i> wants <i>Meat</i> or
<i>Drink</i> When I am <i>Hungry</i> or <i>Dry</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> And
therefore I ought not to Doubt but that
these things are <i>True</i>. And by this <i>sense</i> of
<i>Pain</i>, <i>Hunger</i>, <i>Thirst</i>, &amp;c. My <i>Nature</i> tells<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
me that <i>I</i> am not in my <i>Body</i>, as a <i>Mariner</i>
is in his <i>Ship</i>, but that I am most <i>nighly conjoyn’d</i>
thereto, and as it were <i>Blended
therewith</i>; so that <i>I</i> with <i>It</i> make up <i>one</i>
thing; For Otherwise, when the <i>Body</i>
were hurt, <i>I</i>, who am only a <i>Thinking
Thing</i>, should not therefore <i>feel</i> Pain, but
should only <i>perceive</i> the Hurt with the
<i>Eye</i> of my <i>Understanding</i> (as a <i>Mariner
perceives</i> by his <i>sight</i> whatever is broken
in his Ship) and when the <i>Body</i> wants either
Meat or Drink, I should only <i>Understand</i>
this want, but should not have
the <i>Confused sense</i> of <i>Hunger</i> or <i>Thirst</i>; I
call them <i>Confused</i>, for certainly the <i>Sense</i>
of <i>Thirst</i>, <i>Hunger</i>, <i>Pain</i>, &amp;c. are only <i>Confused
Modes</i> or <i>Manners</i> of <i>Thought</i> arising
from the <i>Union</i> and (as it were) <i>mixture</i> of
the <i>Mind</i> and <i>Body</i>.</p>

<p>I am taught also by <i>Nature</i>, that there
are many other <i>Bodies Without</i> and <i>About</i>
my <i>Body</i>, some whereof are to be <i>desired</i>,
others are to be <i>Avoided</i>. And because
that I Perceive very Different <i>Colours</i>,
<i>Sounds</i>, <i>Smells</i>, <i>Tasts</i>, <i>Heat</i>, <i>Hardness</i>, and
the Like, from thence I Rightly conclude
that there are <i>Correspondent Differences</i> in
<i>Bodies</i>, from which these <i>different perceptions</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
of <i>sense</i> proceed, tho perhaps not <i>Alike</i>.
And because that some of these <i>perceptions</i>
are <i>Pleasant</i>, others <i>Unpleasant</i>, ’tis evidently
<i>certain</i>, that my <i>Body</i>, or rather
my <i>Whole self</i> (as <i>I</i> am compounded of a
<i>Mind</i> and <i>Body</i>) am liable to be <i>Affected</i>
by these <i>Bodies</i> which encompass me about.</p>

<p>There are many Other Things Also
which <i>Nature</i> seems to teach Me, but <i>Really</i>
I am not taught by It, but have gotten
them by an <i>ill use</i> of Passing my Judgement
<i>Inconsiderately</i>, and from hence it is
that these things happen often to be <i>false</i>;
as that all <i>space</i> is <i>Empty</i>, in which I find
<i>nothing</i> that <i>works</i> upon my <i>Senses</i>; That
in a <i>hot Body</i> there is something <i>like</i> the <i>Idea</i>
of <i>Heat</i> which is in me; That in a <i>White</i>
or <i>Green</i> Body there is the same <i>Whiteness</i>
or <i>Greenness</i> which I <i>perceive</i>; And the
same <i>Taste</i> in a <i>bitter</i> or <i>sweet</i> Thing, <i>&amp;c.</i>
That <i>Stars</i>, <i>Castles</i>, and Other <i>Remote</i> Bodies
are of the same <i>Bigness</i> and <i>Shape</i>,
as they are <i>Represented</i> to my <i>senses</i>: and
such like. But that I may not admit of
any Thing in this very matter, which I
cannot <i>Distinctly</i> perceive, it behoves me
here to determine more <i>Accurately</i> What I
mean when I say, <i>That I am taught a Thing
by Nature</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>Here I take <i>Nature</i> more <i>strictly</i>, then
for the <i>Complication</i> of all those Things
which are Given me by <i>God</i>; For in this
<i>Complication</i> there are many things contain’d
which relate to the <i>Mind alone</i>, as,
That I perceive What is <i>done</i> cannot be <i>not
Done</i>, and all Other things which are
known by the <i>Light</i> of <i>Nature</i>, but of
these I speak not at present. There are
also many Other Things which belong <i>only</i>
to the <i>Body</i>, as, That it <i>tends Downwards</i>
and such like, of these also I treat not at
Present. But I speak of those Things
only which <i>God</i> hath bestowed upon me
as I am <i>Compounded</i> of a <i>Mind</i> and <i>Body
together</i>, and not <i>differently Consider’d</i>. ’Tis
<i>Nature</i> therefore thus taken that teaches
me to <i>avoid troublesome Objects</i>, and <i>seek</i>
after <i>pleasing Ones</i>; but it appears not
that this <i>Nature</i> teaches us to conclude any
thing of these Perceptions of our
<i>senses</i>, before that we make by our <i>Understanding</i>
a diligent examination of <i>outward Objects</i>;
for to Enquire into the <i>Truth</i>
of Things belongs not to the <i>Whole Compositum</i>
of a Man as he Consists of <i>Mind</i>
and <i>Body</i>, but to the <i>Mind alone</i>.</p>

<p>So that tho a <i>star affect</i> my eye no <i>more</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
then a <i>small spark</i> of Fire, yet there is in
my Eye no <i>Real</i> or <i>Positive Inclination</i> to
<i>believe</i> One no bigger then the Other, but
thus I have been used to Judge from my
Childhood without any Reason: and tho
coming nigh the Fire I feel Heat, and
Coming too nigh I feel Pain, yet there is
no Reason to perswade me, That in the
Fire there is any thing <i>like</i> either that
Heat or that Pain, but only that there is
something therein, Whatever it be, that
excites in us those <i>sensations</i> of Heat or
Pain: and so tho in some space there
may be nothing that Works on my <i>senses</i>,
it does not from thence follow, that there
is no <i>Body</i> there; for I see that in these
and many other things I am used to overturn
the Order of Nature, because I use
these <i>perceptions</i> of <i>sense</i> (which properly
are given me by Nature to make known
to the mind what is <i>advantagious</i> or <i>hurtful</i>
to the <i>Compositum</i>, whereof the <i>mind</i>
is part, and <i>so far</i> only they are <i>Clear</i> and
<i>Distinct</i> enough) as <i>certain Rules</i> immediately
to discover the <i>Essence</i> of <i>External
Bodies</i>, of Which they make known nothing
but very <i>Obscurely</i> and <i>Confusedly</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Medit. 4.</div>

<p>I have * formerly shewn how
my <i>Judgement</i> happens to be false
notwithstanding <i>Gods Goodness</i>. But
now there arises a new <i>Difficulty</i> concerning
those very things which <i>Nature</i> tells
me I am to <i>prosecute</i> or <i>avoid</i>, concerning
my <i>Internal senses</i>, Wherein I find
many <i>Errors</i>, as when a Man being deceived
by the Pleasant Taste of some sort
of Meat, devours therein some hidden
Poyson. But in this very Instance it
cannot be said, that the Man is impelled
by Nature to desire the <i>Poyson</i>, for of that
he is wholly Ignorant; but he is said to
Desire the <i>Meat</i> only as being of a grateful
Taste; and from hence nothing can be
concluded but, That <i>Mans-Nature</i> is not
<i>All-knowing</i>; which is no Wonder seeing
Man is a <i>Finite Being</i>, and therefore
nothing but <i>Finite Perfections</i> belong
to him.</p>

<p>But We often err even in those things
to Which we are <i>Impelled</i> by <i>Nature</i>, as
when sick men desire that <i>Meat</i> or <i>Drink</i>,
which will certainly prove Hurtful to
them. To this it may perhaps be reply’d,
That they <i>Err</i> in this because their <i>Nature</i>
is <i>Corrupt</i>. But this Answers not the Difficulty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
For a sick man is no less <i>Gods Creature</i>
then a Man in Health, and therefore
’tis as Absurd to Imagine a <i>Deceitful Nature</i>
imposed by <i>God</i> on the One as on the
Other; And as a Clock that is made up
of Wheels and Weights does no less strictly
observe the <i>Laws</i> of its <i>Nature</i>, when
it is <i>ill</i> contrived, and tells the hours <i>falsly</i>,
as when it answers the Desire of the Artificer
in all performances; so if I consider
the body of a Man as a meer <i>Machine</i>
or <i>Movement</i>, made up and compounded
of <i>Bones</i>, <i>Nerves</i>, <i>Muscles</i>, <i>Veins</i>, <i>Blood</i>, and
<i>Skin</i>; so that, tho there were no <i>mind</i> in
It, yet It would perform all those Motions
which now are in it (those only excepted
which Proceed from the <i>Will</i>, and consequently
from the <i>Mind</i>) I do easily acknowledge,
that it would be as <i>natural</i> for
him (if for example sake he were sick of
a <i>Dropsie</i>) to suffer that <i>Driness</i> of his
<i>Throat</i> which uses to bring into his mind
the <i>sense</i> of <i>Thirst</i>, &amp; that thereby his Nerves
and other Parts would be so disposed as to
take Drink, by Which his disease would
be encreased; As (supposing him to be
troubled with no such Distemper) by the
like Driness of Throat he would be disposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
to Drink, when ’tis Requisite.
And tho, if I respect the Intended use
of a Clock I may say that it <i>Errs</i> from its
<i>Nature</i>, when it tells the Hours <i>wrong</i>, and
so considering the <i>Movement</i> of a <i>Mans Body</i>
as contrived for such <i>Motions</i> as are used
to be performed thereby, I may think That
also to <i>Err</i> from its <i>Nature</i>, if its <i>Throat</i> is
<i>Dry</i>, when it has no want of Drink for
its <i>Preservation</i>. Yet I Plainly discover,
that this last <i>Acceptation</i> of <i>Nature</i> differs
much from that whereof we have been
speaking all this While, for this is only a
<i>Denomination extrinsick</i> to the Things
whereof ’tis spoken, and <i>depending</i> on my
<i>Thought</i>, while it <i>Compares</i> a <i>sick</i> man, and
a <i>disorderly</i> Clock with the <i>Idea</i> of an
<i>healthy</i> man and a <i>Rectified</i> Clock. But by
<i>Nature</i> in its former <i>Acceptation</i> I Understand
something that is <i>Really</i> in the <i>Things</i>
themselves, which therefore has something
of <i>Truth</i> in it.</p>

<p>But tho Respecting only a <i>Body sick</i> of
a Dropsie it be an <i>Extrinsick Denomination</i>
to say, that its <i>Nature</i> is <i>Corrupt</i>, because it
has a <i>Dry Throat</i>, and stands in <i>no need</i> of
Drink; yet respecting the <i>Whole Compound</i>
or <i>Mind joyn’d</i> to such a <i>Body</i>, ’tis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
not a <i>meer Denomination</i>, but a <i>real Error</i>
of <i>Nature</i> for it to <i>thirst</i> when <i>drink</i>
is <i>hurtful</i> to it. It remains therefore here
to be inquired, how the <i>Goodness</i> of <i>God</i>
suffers <i>Nature so taken</i> to be <i>deceivable</i>.</p>

<p>First therefore I understand that a
<i>chief difference</i> between my <i>Mind</i> and
<i>Body</i> consists in this, That my <i>Body</i> is of
its <i>Nature divisible</i>, but my <i>Mind indivisible</i>;
for while I consider my <i>Mind</i>
or <i>my self</i>, as I am only a <i>thinking Thing</i>,
I can distinguish <i>no parts</i> in Me, but I
perceive my self to be but <i>one entire</i>
Thing; and tho the <i>whole Mind</i> seems
to be <i>united</i> to the <i>whole Body</i>, yet a Foot,
an Arm, or any other part of the Body
being cut off, I do not therefore conceive
any <i>part</i> of my <i>Mind</i> taken away;
Neither can its <i>Faculties</i> of <i>desiring</i>, <i>perceiving</i>,
<i>understanding</i>, &amp;c. be called its
<i>Parts</i>, for ’tis one and the <i>same</i>, <i>mind</i>, that
<i>desires</i>, that <i>perceives</i>, that <i>understands</i>;
Contrarily, I cannot think of any <i>Corporeal</i>
or <i>extended Being</i>, which I cannot
easily <i>divide</i> into <i>Parts</i> by my thought,
and by this I understand it to be <i>divisible</i>.
And this alone (if I had known it from
no other Argument) is sufficient to inform<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
me, that my <i>mind</i> is <i>really distinct</i>
from my <i>Body</i>.</p>

<p>Nextly I find, that my <i>mind</i> is not <i>immediately
affected</i> by all parts of my <i>body</i>,
but only by the <i>Brain</i>, and perhaps only
by one small part of it, That, to wit,
wherein the <i>common sense</i> is said to reside;
Which part, as often as it is disposed in
the <i>same manner</i>, will represent to the
<i>mind</i> the <i>same thing</i>, tho at the same time
the other parts of the <i>body</i> may be <i>differently</i>
order’d. And this is proved by
numberless Experiments, which need not
here be related.</p>

<p>Moreover I discover that the <i>nature</i> of
my <i>body</i> is such, that no part of it can
be <i>moved</i> by an other <i>remote</i> part thereof,
but it may also be <i>moved</i> in the <i>same
manner</i> by some of the <i>interjacent</i> parts,
tho the more <i>remote</i> part lay still and acted
not; As for example in the Rope,</p>

<p class="center">A⸺B⸺C⸺D</p>

<p class="noindent">if its end D. were drawn, the end A.
would be moved no otherwise, than if
one of the intermediate parts B. or C.
were drawn, and the end D. rest quiet.
So when I feel <i>pain</i> in my <i>Foot</i>, the consideration
of Physicks instructs me, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
this is performed by the help of <i>Nerves</i>
dispersed through the Foot, which from
thence being <i>continued</i> like Ropes to the
very Brain, whilst they are <i>drawn</i> in the
Foot, they also <i>draw</i> the inward parts of
the Brain to which they reach, and therein
excite a certain <i>motion</i>, which is ordain’d
by <i>Nature</i> to affect the <i>mind</i> with
a <i>sense</i> of <i>Pain</i>, as being in the <i>Foot</i>. But
because these Nerves must pass through the
<i>Shin</i>, the <i>Thighs</i>, the <i>Loins</i>, the <i>Back</i>, the
<i>Neck</i>, before they can reach the <i>Brain</i>
from the <i>Foot</i>, it may so happen, that tho
<i>that part</i> of them, which is in the Foot
were not touch’d, but only some of their
<i>intermediate parts</i>, yet the same <i>motion</i>,
would be caused in the <i>Brain</i>, as when
the <i>Foot</i> it self is <i>ill affected</i>, from whence
’twill necessarily follow, that the <i>mind</i>
should <i>perceive</i> the same <i>Pain</i>. And thus
may we think of any other <i>Sense</i>.</p>

<p>I understand lastly, that seeing each
single motion perform’d in that part of
the <i>Brain</i>, which <i>immediately affects</i> the
<i>mind</i>, excites therein only one sort of
<i>sense</i>, nothing could be contrived more
conveniently in this case, than that, of
all those <i>Senses</i> which it can cause, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
should cause that which <i>cheifly</i>, and most
<i>frequently</i> conduces to the <i>conservation</i> of
an <i>healthful Man</i>; And experience witnesses,
that to this very <i>end</i> all our <i>senses</i>
are given us by <i>Nature</i>; and therefore
nothing can be found therein, which does
not abundantly testifie the <i>Power</i> and
<i>Goodness</i> of <i>God</i>. Thus for Example,
when the Nerves of the Feet are violently
and more than ordinarily moved, that
motion of them being propagated through
the <i>Medulla Spinalis</i> of the Back to the
inward parts of the Brain, there it signifies
to the mind, that something or other
is to be felt, and what is this but
Pain, as if it were in the Foot, by which
the Mind is excited to use its indeavours
for removing the Cause, as being hurtful
to the Foot. But the <i>Nature</i> of <i>Man</i>
might have been so <i>order’d</i> by <i>God</i>, that
That same motion in the Brain should represent
to the mind any other thing, <i>viz.</i>
either it self as ’tis in the Brain, or it self
as it is in the Foot, or in any of the other
forementioned intermediate parts, or
lastly any other thing whatsoever; but
none of these would have so much conduced
to the <i>Conservation</i> of the <i>Body</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
In the like manner when we want drink,
from thence arises a certain <i>dryness</i> in the
<i>Throat</i>, which moves the Nerves thereof,
and by their means the inward parts of
the Brain, and this motion <i>affects</i> the <i>mind</i>
with the <i>sense</i> of <i>thirst</i>; because that in
this case nothing is more requisite for us
to know, then that we <i>want drink</i> for the
<i>Preservation</i> of our <i>Health</i>. So of the
Rest.</p>

<p>From all which ’tis manifest, that (notwithstanding
the <i>infinite Goodness</i> of God)
’tis impossible but the <i>Nature</i> of <i>Man</i> as
he consists of a <i>mind</i> and <i>body</i> should be
<i>deceivable</i>. For if any cause should excite
(not in the Foot but) in the Brain
it self, or in any other part through which
the Nerves are continued from the Foot
to the Brain, that <i>self same</i> motion, which
uses to arise from the Foot being troubled,
the <i>Pain</i> would be felt <i>as in the Foot</i>, and
the <i>sense</i> would be <i>naturally</i> deceived;
for ’tis consonant to Reason (seeing that
That same motion of the Brain alwayes
represents to the mind that same sense,
and it oftner proceeds from a cause <i>hurtful</i>
to the <i>Foot</i>, than from any other) I
say ’tis reasonable, that it should make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
known to the <i>mind</i> the Pain of the <i>Foot</i>,
rather than of any other <i>part</i>. And so
if a <i>dryness</i> of <i>Throat</i> arises (not as ’tis
used from the <i>necessity</i> of <i>drink</i> for the
<i>conservation</i> of the <i>Body</i>, but) from an
<i>unusual Cause</i>, as it happens in a <i>Dropsie</i>,
’tis far better that it should <i>then deceive
us</i>; then that it should <i>alwayes deceive</i> us
when the <i>Body</i> is in <i>Health</i>, and so of the
Rest.</p>

<p>And this consideration helps me very
much, not only to <i>understand</i> the <i>Errors</i>
to which my <i>Nature</i> is subject, but also to
<i>correct</i> and <i>avoid</i> them. For seeing I
know that all my <i>Senses</i> do oftener inform
me <i>falsly</i> than <i>truely</i> in those things
which conduce to the <i>Bodies advantage</i>;
and seeing I can use (almost alwayes)
more of them than one to <i>Examine</i> the
same thing, as also I can use <i>memory</i>, which
joyns present and past things together,
and my <i>understanding</i> also, which hath
already discovered to me all the <i>causes</i> of
my <i>Errors</i>, I ought no longer to fear,
that what my <i>Senses</i> daily represent to me
should be false. But especially those <i>extravagant
Doubts</i> of my First Meditation
are to be turn’d off as ridiculous; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
perticularly the <i>chief</i> of them, <i>viz</i>. That
<a href="#note14" id="anchor12">*</a> of not <i>distinguishing Sleep</i> from <i>Waking</i>,
for now I plainly discover a great <i>difference</i>,
between them, for my <i>Dreams</i> are
never <i>conjoyned</i> by my <i>memory</i> with the
other <i>actions</i> of <i>my life</i>, as whatever happens
to me <i>awake</i> is; and certainly if
(while I were awake) any person should
suddenly appear to me, and presently
disappear (as in <i>Dreams</i>) so that I could
not tell <i>from whence</i> he came or <i>where</i> he
went, I should rather esteem it a <i>Spectre</i>
or <i>Apparition feign’d</i> in my Brain, then a
<i>true Man</i>; but when such things occur,
as I distinctly know from <i>whence</i>, <i>where</i>,
and <i>when</i> they come, and I <i>conjoyn</i> the
<i>perception</i> of them by my <i>memory</i> with the
other <i>Accidents</i> of my <i>life</i>, I am <i>certain</i>
they are represented to me <i>waking</i> and
not <i>asleep</i>, neither ought I in the least to
doubt of their <i>Truth</i>, if after I have called
up all my <i>senses</i>, <i>memory</i>, and <i>understanding</i>
to their <i>Examination</i> I find nothing
in any of them, that clashes with other
truths; For <i>God</i> not being a <i>Deceiver</i>,
it follows, that In such things I am not
<i>deceived</i>. But because the <i>urgency</i> of <i>Action</i>
in the common <i>occurrences</i> of <i>Affairs</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
will not alwayes allow time for such an
<i>accurate examination</i>, I must confess that
<i>Mans life</i> is <i>subject</i> to many <i>Errors</i> about
<i>perticulars</i>, so that the <i>infirmity</i> of our <i>Nature</i>
must be <i>acknowledged</i> by Us.</p>

</div>

<p>Among seven Parcels of Objections
made by Divers Learned
Persons against these Meditations,
I have made choise of the Third in
the Latine Copy, as being Penn’d by
<i>Thomas Hobbs</i> of <i>Malmesbury</i>, a Man
famously known to the World abroad,
but especially to his own the
English Nation; and therefore ’tis
likely that what comes from Him
may be more acceptable to his Countrymen,
then what proceeds from a
Stranger; and as the strength of a
Fortification is never better known
then by a Forcible Resistance, so fares<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
it with these <i>Meditations</i> which stand
unshaken by the Violent Opposition
of so Potent an Enemy. And yet it
must be Confess’d that the Force of
these Objections and Cogency of the
Arguments cannot be well apprehended
by those who are not versed
in other Pieces of Mr. <i>Hobbs</i>’s Philosophy,
especially His Book <i>De Corpore</i>
and <i>De Homine</i>, The former
whereof I am sure is Translated into
English, and therefore not Impertinently
refer’d to Here in a Discourse
to English Readers. And this is the
Reason that makes the Great <i>Des-Cartes</i>
pass over many of these Objections
so slightly, Who certainly
would have Undermined the whole
Fabrick of the <i>Hobbian Philosophy</i>
had he but known upon What
Foundations it was Built.</p>

</div>

<p>’Tis evident enough from What
has been said in this Meditation,
that there is no <i>sign</i> by Which
we may Distinguish our <i>Dreams</i> from <i>True<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
Sense</i> and <i>Waking</i>, and therefore that those
<i>Phantasmes</i> which we have waking and
from our Senses are not accidents inhering
in Outward Objects, neither do they
Prove that such outward Objects do Exist;
and therefore if we trust our Senses
without any other Ground, we may well
doubt whether any Thing <i>Be</i> or <i>Not</i>. We
therefore acknowledge the Truth of this
Meditation. But Because <i>Plato</i> and other
Antient Philosophers argued for the
same <i>incertainty</i> in sensible Things, and because
’tis commonly Observed by the Vulgar
that ’tis hard to Distinguish Sleep from
Waking, I would not have the most excellent
Author of such new Thoughts put
forth so antique Notions.</p>

<h4 class="gesperrt">ANSWER.</h4>

<p>Those Reasons of Doubt which by
this Philosopher are admitted as <i>true</i>,
were proposed by Me only as <i>Probable</i>,
and I made use of them not that I may
vend them as <i>new</i>, but partly that I may
prepare the Minds of my Readers for the
Consideration of Intellectual Things,
wherein they seem’d to me very necessary;
And partly that thereby I may shew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
how firm those Truths are, which hereafter
I lay down, seeing they cannot be
Weaken’d by these Metaphysical Doubts:
So, that I never designed to gain any Honor
by repeating them, but I think I could

<i class="smaller">Against the Second Meditation: Of the Nature
of Mans Mind.</i></h3>

</div>

<p>I <i>am a Thinking Thing</i>. ’Tis True;
for because I <i>think</i> or have a <i>Phantasme</i>
(whether I am <i>awake</i> or <i>asleep</i>) it follows
that <i>I am Thinking</i>, for <i>I Think</i> and <i>I
am Thinking</i> signifie the same Thing. Because
<i>I Think</i>, it follows That <i>I am</i>, for
whatever <i>Thinks</i> cannot be <i>Nothing</i>. But
when he Adds, <i>That is</i>, <i>a Mind</i>, <i>a Soul</i>, <i>an
Understanding</i>, <i>Reason</i>, I question his Argumentation;
for it does not seem a Right
Consequence to say, <i>I am a Thinking Thing</i>,
therefore <i>I am a Thought</i>, neither, <i>I am an
Understanding Thing</i>, therefore <i>I am the
Understanding</i>. For in the same manner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
I may Conclude, <i>I am a Walking Thing</i>,
therefore <i>I am the Walking it self</i>.</p>

<p>Wherefore <i>D.Cartes</i> Concludes that
an <i>Understanding Thing</i> and <i>Intellection</i>
(which is the <i>Act</i> of an Understanding
Thing) are the same; or at least
that an <i>Understanding Thing</i> and the <i>Intellect</i>
(which is the <i>Power</i> of an Understanding
Thing) are the same; And yet all Philosophers
distinguish the <i>subject</i> from its <i>Faculties</i>
and <i>Acts</i>, that is, from its <i>Properties</i>
and <i>Essence</i>, for the <i>Thing it self</i> is one
thing, and its <i>Essence</i> is an other. It may
be therefore that a <i>Thinking Thing</i> is the
<i>Subject</i> of a <i>Mind</i>, <i>Reason</i>, or <i>Understanding</i>,
and therefor it may be a <i>Corporeal
Thing</i>, the Contrary Whereof is here <i>Assumed</i>
and not <i>Proved</i>; and yet this <i>Inference</i>
is the <i>Foundation</i> of that Conclusion
which <i>D.Cartes</i> would Establish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">* <i>Places noted with this Asterick are the Passages of the
foregoing Meditations here Objected against.</i></div>

<p>In the same Meditation,
on, * <i>I know that I am,
I ask, What I am Whom I
Thus Know, Certainly the
Knowledge of Me precisely
so taken depends not on those
Things of whose Existence I am yet Ignorant</i>.</p>

<p>’Tis Certain the Knowledge of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
Proposition <i>I am</i>, depends on this, <i>I think</i>
as he hath rightly inform’d us; but from
whence have we the knowledge of this
Proposition, <i>I think</i>? certainly from
hence only, that we cannot conceive any
<i>Act</i> without its <i>subject</i>, as <i>dancing</i> without
a <i>Dancer</i>, <i>knowledge</i>, without a <i>Knower</i>,
<i>thought</i> without a <i>thinker</i>.</p>

<p>And from hence it seems to follow,
that a <i>thinking Thing</i> is a <i>Corporeal Thing</i>;
for the <i>Subjects</i> of all <i>Acts</i> are understood
only in a <i>Corporeal way</i>, or after the manner
of <i>matter</i>, as he himself shews hereafter
by the example of a piece of Wax,
which changing its <i>colour</i>, <i>consistence</i>, <i>shape</i>,
and other <i>Acts</i> is yet known to continue
the <i>same thing</i>, that is, the <i>same matter subject</i>
to so many <i>changes</i>. But I cannot
conclude from another <i>thought</i> that <i>I now
think</i>; for tho a Man may <i>think</i> that he
<i>hath thought</i> (which consists only in <i>memory</i>)
yet ’tis altogether impossible for him to
<i>think</i> that he <i>now thinks</i>, or to <i>know</i>, that <i>he
knows</i>, for the question may be put <i>infinitely</i>,
how do you <i>know</i> that you <i>know</i>, that
you <i>know</i>, that you <i>know</i>? &amp;c.</p>

<p>Wherefore seeing the Knowledge of
this Proposition <i>I am</i>, depends on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
knowledge of this <i>I think</i>, and the knowledge
of this is from hence only, that we
cannot separate <i>thought</i> from <i>thinking matter</i>,
it seems rather to follow, that a <i>thinking
thing</i> is <i>material</i>, than that ’tis <i>immaterial</i>.</p>

<h4 class="gesperrt">ANSWER.</h4>

<p>When I said, <i>That is a Mind</i>, <i>a Soul</i>, <i>an
Understanding</i>, <i>Reason</i>, &amp;c. I did not
mean by these <i>names</i> the <i>Faculties</i> only,
but the <i>things</i> indow’d with those <i>Faculties</i>;
and so ’tis alwayes understood by
the two first names (<i>mind</i> and <i>soul</i>) and
very often so understood by the two last
Names (<i>understanding</i> and <i>Reason</i>) and
this I have explain’d so often, and in so
many places of these Meditations, that
there is not the least occasion of questioning
my meaning.</p>

<p>Neither is there any parity between
<i>Walking</i> and <i>Thought</i>, for <i>walking</i> is used
only for the <i>Act</i> it self, but <i>thought</i> is
sometimes used for the <i>Act</i>, sometimes for
the <i>Faculty</i>, and sometimes for the <i>thing</i> it
self, wherein the <i>Faculty</i> resides.</p>

<p>Neither do I say, that the <i>understanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
thing</i> and <i>intellection</i> are the same, or
that the <i>understanding thing</i> and the <i>intellect</i>
are the same, if the <i>intellect</i> be taken
for the <i>Faculty</i>, but only when ’tis taken
for the <i>thing it self that understands</i>.
Yet I willingly confess, that I have (as
much as in me lay) made use of <i>abstracted
words</i> to signifie that <i>thing</i> or <i>substance</i>,
which I would have devested of all those
things that belong not to it. Whereas
contrarily this Philosopher uses the most
<i>concrete Words</i> to signifie this <i>thinking thing</i>,
such as <i>subject</i>, <i>matter</i>, <i>Body</i>, &amp;c. that he
may not suffer it to be separated from
<i>Body</i>.</p>

<p>Neither am I concern’d that His manner
of joyning many things together may
seem to some fitter for the discovery of
Truth, than mine, wherein I separate as
much as possibly each particular. But let
us omit words and speak of things.</p>

<p><i>It may be</i> (sayes he) <i>that a Thinking thing
is a corporeal thing, the contrary whereof is
here assumed and not proved.</i> But herein he
is mistaken, for I never <i>assumed</i> the <i>contrary</i>,
neither have I used it as a <i>Foundation</i>,
for the rest of <i>my Superstructure</i>, but
left it wholly <i>undetermin’d</i> till the <i>sixth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
Meditation</i>, and in that ’tis proved.</p>

<p>Then he tells us rightly, <i>that we cannot
conceive any Act without its subject</i>, as <i>thought</i>
without a <i>thinking thing</i>, for what <i>thinks</i>
cannot be <i>nothing</i>; but then he subjoyns
without any Reason, and against the usual
manner of speaking, and contrary to all
Logick, <i>that hence it seem to follow, that a
thinking thing is a corporeal Being</i>. Truly
the <i>subjects</i> of all <i>Acts</i> are understood
under the notion of <i>substance</i>, or if you
please under the notion of <i>matter</i> (that
is to say of <i>metaphysical matter</i>) but not
therefore under the notion of <i>Bodies</i>.</p>

<p>But Logicians and Commonly all Men
are used to say, that there are some <i>Spiritual</i>,
some <i>Corporeal</i> substances. And by
the Instance of Wax I only proved that
<i>Colour</i>, <i>Consistence</i>, <i>Shape</i>, &amp;c. appertain
not to the <i>Ratio Formalis</i> of the Wax;
For in that Place I treated neither of the
<i>Ratio Formalis</i> of the <i>Mind</i>, neither of
<i>Body</i>.</p>

<p>Neither is it pertinent to the business,
that the Philosopher asserts, <i>That one
Thought cannot be the subject of an other
thought</i>, for Who besides Himself ever Imagin’d
This? But that I may explain the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
matter in a few words, ’Tis certain that
<i>Thought</i> cannot be without a <i>Thinking
Thing</i>, neither any <i>Act</i> or any <i>Accident</i>
without a <i>substance</i> wherein it resides.
But seeing that we know not a <i>substance
immediately by it self</i>, but by this alone,
that ’tis the <i>subject</i> of several <i>Acts</i>, it is
very consonant to the commands of Reason
and Custome, that we should call by
<i>different names</i> those <i>substances</i>, which we
perceive are the <i>subjects</i> of very <i>different
Acts</i> or <i>Accidents</i>, and that afterwards we
should examine, whether those <i>different
names</i> signifie <i>different</i> or <i>one</i> and the <i>same</i>
thing. Now there are some <i>Acts</i> which
we call <i>corporeal</i>, as <i>magnitude</i>, <i>figure</i>, <i>motion</i>,
and what ever else cannot be thought
on without <i>local extension</i>, and the <i>substance</i>
wherein these reside we call <i>Body</i>;
neither can it be imagin’d that ’tis one <i>substance</i>
which is the <i>subject</i> of <i>Figure</i>, and
another <i>substance</i> which is the <i>subject</i> of
<i>local motion</i>, &amp;c. Because all these <i>Acts</i> agree
under one common notion of <i>Extension</i>.
Besides there are other <i>Acts</i>,
which we call <i>cogitative</i> or <i>thinking</i>, as
<i>understanding</i>, <i>will</i>, <i>imagination</i>, <i>sense</i>, &amp;c.
All which agree under the common notion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
of <i>thought</i>, <i>perception</i>, or <i>Conscience</i>;
And the <i>substance</i> wherein they are, we
say, is a <i>thinking thing</i>, or <i>mind</i>, or call
it by whatever other name we please, so
we do not confound it with <i>corporeal substance</i>,
because <i>cogitative Acts</i> have no affinity
with <i>corporeal Acts</i>, and <i>thought</i>, which
is the common <i>Ratio</i> of <i>those</i> is wholly different
from <i>Extension</i>, which is the common
<i>Ratio</i> of <i>These</i>. But after we have
formed two <i>distinct conceptions</i> of these
two <i>substances</i>, from what is said in the
sixth Meditation, ’tis easie to know, whether
they be <i>one</i> and the <i>same</i> or <i>different</i>.</p>

<p>* <i>Which of them is it, that
is distinct from my thought?
which of them is it that can be separated
from me?</i></p>

<p>Some perhaps will answer this
Question thus, I my self, who <i>think</i> am distinct
from my <i>thought</i>, and my <i>thought</i> is
<i>different</i> from me (tho’ not <i>seperated</i>) as
<i>dancing</i> is <i>distinguished</i> from the <i>Dancer</i>
(as before is noted.) But if <i>Des-Cartes</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
will prove, that <i>he</i> who <i>understands</i> is
the same with his <i>understanding</i>, we shall
fall into the Scholastick expressions, the
<i>understanding understands</i>, the <i>sight sees</i>,
the <i>Will wills</i>, and then by an exact analogy,
the Walking (or at least the <i>Faculty</i>
of walking) shall walk. All which
are obscure, improper, and unworthy
that perspicuity which is usual with the
noble <i>Des-Cartes</i>.</p>

<h4 class="gesperrt">ANSWER.</h4>

<p>I do not deny, that <i>I</i> who <i>think</i> am
<i>distinct</i> from my <i>thought</i>, as a <i>thing</i> is <i>distinguish’d</i>
from its <i>modus</i> or <i>manner</i>; But
when I ask, <i>which of them is it that is distinct
from my thought</i>? this I understand
of those various <i>modes</i> of <i>thought</i> there
mention’d, and not of <i>substance</i>; and
when I subjoyn, <i>which of them is it that
can be separated from me</i>? I only signifie
that all those <i>modes</i> or <i>manners</i> of <i>thinking</i>
reside in me, neither do I herein perceive
what occasion of <i>doubt</i> or <i>obscurity</i> can be
imagined.</p>

<p>* <i>It remains therefore for me to Confess that
I cannot Imagine what this Wax is, but
that I conceive in my mind What it is.</i></p>

<p>There is a great Difference between <i>Imagination</i>
(that is) having an <i>Idea</i> of a
Thing, and the <i>Conception of the Mind</i>
(that is) a <i>Concluding</i> from <i>Reasoning</i> that a
thing <i>Is</i> or <i>Exists</i>. But <i>Des-Cartes</i> has
not Declared to us in what they Differ.
Besides, the Ancient Aristotelians have
clearly deliver’d as a Doctrine, that <i>substance</i>
is not <i>perceived</i> by <i>sense</i> but is <i>Collected</i>
by <i>Ratiocination</i>.</p>

<p>But what shall we now say, if perhaps
<i>Ratiocination</i> be nothing Else but a <i>Copulation</i>
or <i>Concatenation</i> of <i>Names</i> or <i>Appellations</i>
by this Word <i>Is</i>? From whence
’twill follow that we <i>Collect</i> by <i>Reasoning</i>
nothing <i>of</i> or <i>concerning</i> the <i>Nature</i> of
<i>Things</i>, but of the <i>names</i> of <i>Things</i>, that
is to say, we only discover whether or no
we <i>joyn</i> the <i>Names</i> of <i>Things</i> according to
the <i>Agreements</i> which at Pleasure we have
made concerning their <i>significations</i>; if it
be so (as so it may be) <i>Ratiocination</i> will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
depend on <i>Words</i>, <i>Words</i> on <i>Imagination</i>,
and perhaps <i>Imagination</i> as <i>also Sense</i> on
the <i>Motion</i> of <i>Corporeal Parts</i>; and so the
<i>Mind</i> shall be nothing but <i>Motions</i> in some
Parts of an <i>Organical Body</i>.</p>

<h4 class="gesperrt">ANSWER.</h4>

<p>I have here Explain’d the Difference
between <i>Imagination</i>, and the Meer <i>Conception</i>
of the <i>Mind</i>, by reckoning up in
my Example of the Wax, what it is therein
which we <i>Imagine</i>, and what it is that we
<i>conceive</i> in our <i>Mind</i> only: but besides this,
I have explained in an other Place How
we <i>understand</i> one way, and <i>Imagine</i> an
other way One and the same Thing,
suppose a Pentagone or Five sided Figure.</p>

<p>There is in <i>Ratiocination</i> a <i>Conjunction</i>
not of <i>Words</i>, but of <i>Things signified</i> by
<i>Words</i>; And I much admire that the <i>Contrary</i>
could Possibly enter any Mans
Thoughts; For Who ever doubted but
that a <i>Frenchman</i> and a <i>German</i> may argue
about the <i>same Things</i>, tho they use very
<i>Differing Words</i>? and does not the Philosopher
Disprove himself when he speaks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
of the <i>Agreements which at pleasure we have
made about the significations of Words</i>? for
if he grants that <i>something</i> is <i>Signified</i> by
<i>Words</i>, Why will he not admit that our
Ratiocinations are rather about this <i>something</i>,
then about <i>Words</i> only? and by the
same Right that he concludes the <i>Mind</i> to
be a <i>Motion</i>, he may Conclude Also that
the Earth is Heaven, or What else he
Pleases.</p>

<i class="smaller">Against the Third Meditation of God.</i></h3>

</div>

<p>* <i>Some of These (viz. <span class="antiqua">Humane Thoughts</span>)
are as it were the Images of Things,
and to these alone belongs properly the Name
of an Idea, as when I Think on a Man, a
Chimera, Heaven, an Angel, or God.</i></p>

<p>When I Think on a <i>Man</i> I perceive an
<i>Idea</i> made up of <i>Figure</i> and <i>Colour</i>, whereof
I may <i>doubt</i> whether it be the <i>Likeness</i>
of a <i>Man</i> or not; and so when I think on
<i>Heaven</i>. But when I think on a Chimera,
I perceive an <i>Image</i> or <i>Idea</i>, of which I
may <i>doubt</i> whether it be the <i>Likeness</i> of any
<i>Animal</i> not only at present Existing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
but possible to Exist, or that ever will Exist
hereafter or not.</p>

<p>But thinking on an <i>Angel</i>, there is offer’d
to my Mind sometimes the <i>Image</i> of
a <i>Flame</i>, sometimes the <i>Image</i> of a <i>Pretty
Little Boy</i> with <i>Wings</i>, which I am certain
has no <i>Likeness</i> to an <i>Angel</i>, and therefore
that it is not the <i>Idea</i> of an <i>Angel</i>; But beleiving
that there are some Creatures,
Who do (as it were) wait upon God, and
are Invisible, and Immaterial, upon the
<i>Thing Believed</i> or <i>supposed</i> we Impose the
<i>Name</i> of <i>Angel</i>; Whereas the <i>Idea</i>, under
which I Imagine an Angel, is compounded
of the Ideas of sensible Things.</p>

<p>In the like manner at the Venerable
Name of <i>God</i>, we have <i>no Image</i> or <i>Idea</i>
of God, and therefore we are forbidden
to <i>Worship God</i> under any <i>Image</i>, least we
should seem to <i>Conceive</i> Him that is inconceivable.</p>

<p>Whereby it appears that we have no <i>Idea</i>
of <i>God</i>; but like one <i>born blind</i>, who
being brought to the <i>Fire</i>, and perceiving
himself to be <i>Warmed</i>, knows there is <i>something</i>
by which he is <i>warmed</i> and Hearing it
called <i>Fire</i>, he Concludes that <i>Fire Exists</i>,
but yet knows not of what <i>shape</i> or <i>Colour</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
the Fire is, neither has he any
<i>Image</i> or <i>Idea</i> thereof in his <i>Mind</i>.</p>

<p>So Man knowing that there must be
some <i>Cause</i> of his <i>Imaginations</i> or <i>Ideas</i>, as
also an other <i>cause before That</i>, and so <i>onwards</i>,
he is brought at last to an <i>End</i>, or
to a <i>supposal</i> of some <i>Eternal Cause</i>, Which
because it never <i>began</i> to <i>Be</i> cannot have
any other <i>Cause before it</i>, and thence he
Concludes that ’tis <i>necessary</i> that some <i>Eternal
Thing Exist</i>: and yet he has no <i>Idea</i>
which He can call the <i>Idea</i> of this <i>Eternal
Thing</i>, but he names this <i>Thing</i>, which
he believes and acknowledges by the
Name <i>God</i>.</p>

<p>But now <i>Des-Cartes</i> proceeds from this
Position, <i>That we have an Idea of God in
our Mind</i>, to prove this Theoreme, <i>That
God (that if an Almighty, Wise, Creatour of
the World) Exists</i>, whereas he ought to
have explain’d this <i>Idea</i> of <i>God</i> better, and
he should have thence deduced not only
his <i>Existence</i>, but also the <i>Creation</i> of the
World.</p>

<h4 class="gesperrt">ANSWER.</h4>

<p>Here the Philosopher will have the
Word <i>Idea</i> be only Understood for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
<i>Images</i> of <i>Material</i> Things represented in
a <i>Corporeal</i> Phantasie, by which Position
he may Easily Prove, that there can be no
Proper <i>Idea</i> of an <i>Angel</i> or <i>God</i>. Whereas
as I declare every Where, but especially
in this Place, that I take the
Name <i>Idea</i> for whatever is immediately
<i>perceived</i> by the <i>Mind</i>, so that when
I <i>Will</i>, or <i>Fear</i>, because at the same
time I <i>perceive</i> that I <i>Will</i> or <i>Fear</i>, this
very <i>Will</i> or <i>Fear</i> are reckon’d by me among
the number of <i>Ideas</i>; And I have
purposely made use of that Word, because
It was usual with the Antient Philosophers
to signifie the Manner of <i>Perceptions</i>
in the <i>Divine Mind</i>, altho neither
we nor they acknowledge a Phantasie in
<i>God</i>: and besides I had no fitter Word to
express it by.</p>

<p>And I think I have sufficiently explain’d
the <i>Idea</i> of <i>God</i> for those that will attend
my meaning, but I can never do it fully enough
for those that will Understand my
Words otherwise then I intend them.</p>

<p>Lastly, what is here added concerning
the <i>Creation</i> of the World is wholly beside
the Question in hand.</p>

<p>* <i>But there are Other (<span class="antiqua">Thoughts</span>)
That have Superadded Forms to
them, as when I Will, when I Fear, when
I Affirm, when I Deny; I know I have alwayes
(whenever I think) some certain
thing as the Subject or Object of my
Thought, but in this last sort of Thoughts
there is something More which I think upon
then Barely the Likeness of the Thing;
and of these Thoughts some are called Wills
and Affections, and others of them Judgements.</i></p>

<p>When any one <i>Fears</i> or <i>Wills</i>, he has
certainly the <i>Image</i> of the <i>Thing Fear’d</i>,
or <i>Action Will’d</i>, but what more a <i>Willing</i>
or <i>Fearing</i> Man has in his Thoughts is not
explain’d; and tho <i>Fear</i> be a <i>Thought</i>,
yet I see not how it can be any other
then the <i>Thought</i> of the <i>Thing Fear’d</i>;
For what is the <i>Fear</i> of a <i>Lion rushing on
me</i>, but the <i>Idea</i> of a Lion Rushing on me,
and the <i>Effect</i> (which that <i>Idea</i> produces
in the <i>Heart</i>) whereby the Man <i>Fearing</i>
is excited to that Animal Motion which
is called Flight? but now this Motion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
<i>Flying</i> is not <i>Thought</i>, it remains therefore
that in <i>Fear</i> there is no other <i>Thought</i>,
but that which consists in the <i>likeness</i> of
the thing. And the same may be said of
<i>Will</i>.</p>

<p>Moreover <i>Affirmation</i> and <i>Negation</i> are
not without a <i>voice</i> and <i>words</i>, and hence
’tis that Brutes can neither <i>affirme</i> or <i>deny</i>
not so much as in their Thought, and
consequently neither can they judge.
But yet the same thought may be in a
beast as in a Man; for when we <i>affirme</i>
that a Man runs, we have not a <i>thought</i>
different from what a Dog has when he
sees his Master running; <i>Affirmation</i>
therefore or <i>Negation</i> superadds nothing
to <i>meer thoughts</i>, unless perhaps it adds
this thought, that the <i>names</i> of which an
<i>Affirmation</i> consists are (to the Person
<i>affirming</i>) the <i>Names</i> of the <i>same thing</i>;
and this is not to comprehend in the
<i>thought</i> more then the <i>likeness</i> of the <i>thing</i>,
but it is only comprehending the same
<i>likeness twice</i>.</p>

<h4 class="gesperrt">ANSWER.</h4>

<p>’Tis self evident, That ’tis one thing to

’tis one thing to <i>see</i> a Man Running, and
an other thing to <i>Affirme</i> within my self
(which may be done without a voice)

<p>I have before often noted that there
can be no <i>Idea</i> of <i>God</i> or the <i>Mind</i>: I
will now superadd, That neither can
there be an <i>Idea</i> of <i>Substance</i>. For <i>Substance</i>
(Which is only <i>Matter Subject</i> to <i>Accidents</i>
and <i>Changes</i>) is <i>Collected</i> only by
<i>Reasoning</i>, but it is not at all <i>Conceived</i>,
neither does it <i>represent</i> to us any <i>Idea</i>. And
if this be true, How can it be said, <i>That
those Ideas which represent to us Substances
have in them something More, or More Objective
Reality, then those which represent to
us Accidents</i>? Besides, Let <i>Des-Cartes</i> again
Consider what he means by <span class="antiqua">More
Reality</span>? Can <i>Reality</i> be increas’d or diminish’d?
Or does he think that One
<i>Thing</i> can be <i>More A Thing</i> then an other
Thing? let him Consider how this can be
Explain’d to our Understandings with
that <i>Perspicuity</i> or Clearness which is requisite
in all <i>Demonstrations</i>, and Which
He Himself is used to present us with upon
other Occasions.</p>

<p>I have often noted before, That that
very Thing which is <i>evidenc’d</i> by <i>Reason</i>,
as also whatever else is perceived by any
other Means, is Called by Me an <i>Idea</i>.
And I have sufficiently explain’d How <i>Reality</i>
may be <i>Encreas’d</i> or <i>Diminish’d</i>, in the
same manner (to wit) as <i>Substance</i> is <i>More</i>
a <i>Thing</i>, then A <i>Mode</i>; and if there be any
such things as <i>Real Qualities</i>, or <i>Incomplete
Substances</i>, these are <i>More Things</i> then
<i>Modes</i>, and <i>Less Things</i> then <i>Complete Substances</i>:
and Lastly if there be an <i>Infinite
Independent Substance</i> this is <i>More</i> a <i>Thing</i>,
then a <i>Finite, Dependent Substance</i>. And
all this is self-evident.</p>

<p><a href="#anchor3" id="note8">*</a> <i>Wherefore There only Remains the
Idea of God; Wherein I must
consider whether there be not something Included,
which cannot Possibly have its Original

Omniscient, Almighty, by whom both I my
self and every thing Else That Is (if any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
thing do actually exist) was Created; All
which attributes are of such an High Nature
That the more attentively I consider them, the
Less I Conceive my self alone possible to be
the Author of these notions; from what
therefore has been said I must Conclude there
is a God.</i></p>

<p>Considering the <i>Attributes</i> of <i>God</i>, that
from thence we may gather an <i>Idea</i> of
<i>God</i>, and that we may enquire whether
there be not something in that <i>Idea</i> which
cannot Possibly Proceed from our selves,
I discover (if I am not Deceived) that
what we think off at the <i>Venerable name</i>
of <i>God</i> proceeds neither from our selves,
neither is it Necessary that they should
have any other <i>Original</i> then from <i>Outward
Objects</i>. For by the Name of <i>God</i>
I understand a <span class="antiqua">Substance</span>, that is, I understand
that <i>God</i> Exists (not by an <i>Idea</i>,
but by Reasoning) <span class="antiqua">Infinite</span> (that is, I
cannot conceive or Imagine Terms or
Parts in him so Extream, but I can Imagine
others Farther) from whence it follows,
that not an <i>Idea</i> of <i>Gods Infinity</i> but
of my Own bounds and Limits presents
it self at the Word <i>Infinite</i>. <span class="antiqua">Independent</span>,
That is, I do not conceive any <i>Cause</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
from which <i>God</i> may proceed; from
whence ’tis evident that I have no other
<i>Idea</i> at the word <i>Independent</i>, but the memory
of my own <i>Ideas</i> which at Different
Times have <i>Different Beginnings</i>, and Consequently
they must be <i>Dependent</i>.</p>

<p>Wherefore, to say that God is <i>Independent</i>,
is only to say That <i>God</i> is in the Number
of those things, the <i>Original</i> whereof I
do not Imagine: and so to say that <i>God</i> is
<i>Infinite</i>, is the same as if we say That He is
in the Number of Those Things whose
<i>Bounds</i> we do not Conceive: And thus
any <i>Idea</i> of <i>God</i> is Exploded, for What <i>Idea</i>
can we have without <i>Beginning</i> or <i>Ending</i>?</p>

<p><span class="antiqua">Omniscient</span> or Understanding all
things, Here <i>I</i> desire to know, by what <i>Idea</i>,
<i>Des-Cartes</i> understands <i>Gods Understanding</i>?
<span class="antiqua">Almighty</span>, I desire also to
know by What <i>Idea Gods Power</i> is <i>understood</i>?
For <i>Power</i> is in Respect of Future
Things, that is, Things not Existing.
For my Part, I understand <i>Power</i>
from the Image or Memory of past Actions,
arguing with my self thus, He did so,
therefore he was <i>able</i> (or had <i>Power</i>) to
do so, therefore (continuing the same) he
will again have <i>Power</i> to do so. But now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
all these are <i>Ideas</i> that may arise from <i>external
Objects</i>.</p>

<p><span class="antiqua">Creatour</span> of all things, <i>I</i> can frame
an <i>Image</i> of <i>Creation</i> from what I see every
day, as a Man Born, or growing
from a Punctum to that shape and size
he now bears; an other <i>Idea</i> then this
no man can have at the word <i>Creatour</i>;
But the <i>Possibility</i> of <i>Imagining</i> a Creation
is not sufficient to prove that the
world <i>was created</i>. And therefore tho
it were <i>Demonstrated</i> that some <i>Infinite
Independent Almighty Being</i> did <i>exist</i>, yet
it will not from thence follow that a <i>Creatour
exists</i>; unless one can think this
to be a right inference, we <i>believe</i> that
there exists something that has created
all other things, therefore the world <i>was
Created</i> thereby.</p>

<p>Moreover when he says, that the <i>Idea</i>
of <i>God</i>, and of our <i>Soul</i> is <i>Innate</i> or <i>born
in us</i>, I would fain know, whether the
<i>Souls</i> of those that <i>sleep soundly</i> do <i>think</i>
unless they <i>dream</i>; If not, then at that
time they have no <i>Ideas</i>, and consequently
no <i>Idea</i> is <i>Innate</i>, for what is <i>Innate</i> to us
is never <i>Absent</i> from us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<h4 class="gesperrt">ANSWER.</h4>

<p>None of <i>Gods</i> Attributes can proceed
from <i>outward objects</i> as from a <i>Pattern</i>,
because there is nothing found in God
like what is found in <i>External</i>, that is,
<i>Corporeal</i> things; Now ’tis manifest that
whatever we think of in him <i>differing</i> or
<i>unlike</i> what we find in them proceeds
not from them, but from a cause of that
very <i>diversity</i> in our Thought.</p>

<p>And here I desire to know, how this
Philosopher deduces <i>Gods Understanding</i>
from <i>outward Things</i>, and yet I can easily
explain what <i>Idea</i> I have thereof, by
saying, that by the <i>Idea</i> of <i>Gods Understanding</i>
I conceive whatever is the <i>Form</i>
of any <i>Perception</i>; For who is there that
does not perceive that he <i>understands</i>
something or other, and consequently
he must thereby have an <i>Idea</i> of <i>understanding</i>,
and by enlarging it <i>Indefinitely</i>
he forms the <i>Idea</i> of <i>Gods Understanding</i>.
And so of his other Attributes.</p>

<p>And seeing we have made use of that
<i>Idea</i> of <i>God</i> which is in us to demonstrate
his existence, and seeing there is contain’d<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
in this <i>Idea</i> such an <i>Immense Power</i>,
that we conceive it a contradiction for
<i>God</i> to <i>Exist</i>, and yet that any thing
should <i>Be</i> besides Him, which was not
<i>Created</i> by Him, it plainly follows that
demonstrating His existence we demonstrate
also that the whole world, or all
things different from <i>God</i>, were <i>Created</i>
by God.</p>

<p>Lastly when we assert, that some <i>Ideas</i>
are <i>Innate</i> or <i>natural</i> to us, we do not
mean that they are always present with
us (for so no <i>Idea</i> would be <i>Innate</i>) but
only that we have in our selves a Faculty
of producing them.</p>

<p>Wherefore seeing ’tis not <i>demonstrated</i>

</div>

<p><a href="#anchor6" id="note10">*</a> <i>By Which I understand that Error (as
it is Error) is not a Real Being, Dependent
on God, but is only a Defect; and
that therefore to make me Err there is not requisite
a Faculty of Erring Given me by
God.</i></p>

<p>’Tis Certain that <i>Ignorance</i> is only a
<i>Defect</i>, and that there is no Occasion of any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
<i>Positive Faculty</i> to make us <i>Ignorant</i>.
But this position is not so clear in Relation
to <i>Error</i>, for Stones and Inanimate
Creatures cannot <i>Err</i>, for this Reason only,
because they have not the <i>Faculties</i> of
<i>Reasoning</i> or <i>Imagination</i>; from whence
’tis Natural for us to Conclude, That to
<i>Err</i> there is requisite a <i>Faculty</i> of <i>Judging</i>,
or at least of <i>Imagining</i>, both which <i>Faculties</i>
are <i>Positive</i>, and given to all <i>Creatures</i>
subject to Error, and to Them
only.</p>

<p>Moreover <i>Des-Cartes</i> says thus, <i>I find</i>
(my Errors) <i>to Depend on two concurring
Causes</i>, viz. <i>on my Faculty of Knowing, and
on my Faculty of Choosing, or Freedom of my
Will</i>. Which seems Contradictious to
what he said before; And here also we
may note, that <i>Freedom of Will</i> is assumed
without any Proof contrary to the Opinion
of the Calvinists.</p>

<h4 class="gesperrt">ANSWER.</h4>

<p>Tho to make us <i>Err</i> there is requisite
a <i>Faculty</i> of <i>Reasoning</i> (or rather of <i>Judging</i>,
that is, of <i>Affirming</i> and <i>Denying</i>) because
<i>Error</i> is the <i>Defect</i> thereof, yet it
does not follow from thence that this <i>Defect</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
is any thing <i>Real</i>, for neither is <i>Blindness</i>
a <i>Real</i> Thing, tho stones cannot be
said to be <i>Blind</i>, for this Reason only, That
they are <i>incapable of sight</i>. And I much
wonder that in all these <i>Objections</i> I have
not found one <i>Right Inference</i>.</p>

<p>I have not here assumed any thing concerning
the <i>Freedom</i> of <i>Mans Will</i>, unless
what all Men do Experience in themselves,
and is most evident by the Light of
Nature. Neither see I any Reason, Why
he should say that this is Contradictious to
any former Position.</p>

<p>Perhaps there may be Many, who respecting
<i>Gods predisposal</i> of Things cannot
Comprehend, How their <i>Freedom</i> of <i>Will</i>
Consists there-with, but yet there is no
Man who, respecting himself only, does
not find by Experience, That ’tis one and
the same Thing to be <i>Willing</i>, and to be
<i>Free</i>. But ’tis no Place to Enquire what
the Opinion of others may be in this Matter.</p>

setting my self to examine such a Thing, it evidently
follows, That I my self Exist, I
could not but Judge, what I so clearly understood,
to be true, not that I was forced thereto
by any outward Impulse, but because a strong
Propension in my Will did follow this Great
Light in my Understanding, so that I believed
it so much the more Freely and Willingly,
by how much the Less indifferent I was thereunto.</i></p>

<p>This expression, <i>Great Light in the Understanding</i>,
is <i>Metaphorical</i>, and therefore
not to be used in Argumentation; And
every one, that Doubts not of his Opinion,
Pretends such a <i>Light</i>, and has no less
a <i>Propension</i> in his <i>Will</i> to Affirm what he
doubts not, than He that <i>really</i> and <i>truely</i>
knows a Thing. Wherefore this <i>Light</i> may
be the cause of <i>Defending</i> and <i>Holding</i> an
Opinion <i>Obstinately</i>, but never of <i>knowing</i>
an Opinion <i>Truly</i>.</p>

<p>Moreover not only the <i>Knowledge</i> of
<i>Truth</i>, but <i>Belief</i> or <i>Giving Assent</i>, are not
the <i>Acts</i> of the <i>Will</i>; for Whatever is
<i>proved</i> by <i>strong Arguments</i>, or <i>Credibly</i>
told, we Believe whether we will or
no.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>’Tis true, To <i>Affirm</i> or <i>Deny</i> Propositions,
to <i>Defend</i> or <i>Oppose</i> Propositions, are
the <i>Acts</i> of the <i>Will</i>; but it does not from
thence Follow that the <i>Internal Assent</i> depends
on the <i>Will</i>. Wherefore the following
Conclusion (<i>so that in the abuse of
our Freedom of Will that Privation consists
which Constitutes Error</i>) is not fully Demonstrated.</p>

<h4 class="gesperrt">ANSWER.</h4>

<p>’Tis not much <i>matter</i>, Whether this expression,
<i>Great Light</i>, be <i>Argumentative</i> or
not, so it be explicative, as really it is,
For all men know, that by <i>light in the
understanding</i> is meant <i>clearness</i> of <i>knowledge</i>,
which every one has not, that <i>thinks</i>
he has; and this hinders not but this <i>light</i>
in the <i>Understanding</i> may be very different
from an <i>obstinate Opinion</i> taken up
without <i>clear perception</i>.</p>

<p>But when ’tis here said, <i>That we assent
to things clearly perceived whether we will
or no</i>, ’tis the same, as if it were said, <i>that
willing or nilling, we desire Good clearly
known</i>; whereas the word <i>Nilling</i>, finds
no room in such Expressions, for it implies,
that we will and nill the same thing.</p>

<p><a href="#anchor9" id="note12">*</a> <i>As when for Example, I imagine a Triangle,
tho perhaps such a Figure exists
no where out of my thoughts, nor ever
will exist, yet the Nature thereof is determinate,
and its Essence or Form is immutable
and eternal, which is neither made by
me nor depends on my mind, as appears
from this, that many propositions may be demonstrated
of this Triangle.</i></p>

<p>If a Triangle be <i>no where</i>, I understand
not how it can have <i>any Nature</i>, for what
is <i>no where</i>, is not, and therefore has not
a <i>Being</i>, or any <i>Nature</i>.</p>

<p>A Triangle in the <i>Mind</i> arises from a
Triangle <i>seen</i>, or from one made up of
what has been <i>seen</i>, but when once we
have given the name of a <i>Triangle</i> to a
thing (from which we think the <i>Idea</i> of
a <i>Triangle</i> arises) tho the Triangle it self
perish, yet the <i>name</i> continues; In the like
manner, when we have once conceived
in our thought, <i>That all the Angles of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
Triangle are equal to two right ones</i>, and
when we have given this other name (viz.
<i>Having its three Angles equal to two right
ones</i>) to a Triangle, tho afterwards there
were no such thing in the World, yet the
<i>Name</i> would still continue, and this Proposition,
<i>A Triangle is a Figure having
three Angles equal to two right Ones</i>, would
be <i>eternally true</i>. But the Nature of a
Triangle will not be eternal if all Triangles
were destroy’d.</p>

<p>This Proposition likewise, <i>A Man is
an Animal</i>, will be <i>true</i> to <i>Eternity</i>, because
the Word <i>Animal</i> will eternally
signifie what the Word <i>Man</i> signifies;
but certainly if <i>Mankind</i> perish, <i>Humane
Nature</i> will be no longer.</p>

<p>From whence ’tis Manifest, That <i>Essence</i>
as ’tis distinguish’d from <i>Existence</i> is
nothing more than the <i>Copulation</i> of
<i>Names</i> by this word <i>Is</i>, and therefore
<i>Essence</i> without <i>Existence</i> is meerly a <i>Fiction</i>
of our own; and as the <i>Image</i> of a
<i>Man</i> in the <i>Mind</i> is to a <i>Man</i>, so it seems
<i>Essence</i> is to <i>Existence</i>. Or as this Proposition
<i>Socrates is a Man</i>, is to this, <i>Socrates
Is or Exists</i>, so is the <i>Essence</i> of <i>Socrates</i>
to his Existence. Now this Proposition,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
<i>Socrates is a Man</i>, when <i>Socrates</i>
does not exist, signifies only the Connection
of the Names, and the word <i>Is</i>
carries under it the <i>Image</i> of the <i>unity</i> of
the thing, which is called by these <i>Two
Names</i>.</p>

<h4 class="gesperrt">ANSWER.</h4>

<p>The Difference between <i>Essence</i> and
<i>Existence</i> is known to all Men. And
what is here said of <i>Eternal Names</i> instead
of <i>Eternal Truth</i>, has been long ago sufficiently
rejected.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
